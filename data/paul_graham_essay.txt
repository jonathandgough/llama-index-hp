HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 1: Getting started as a member
 A. Welcome to HealthPartners MSHO
HealthPartners MSHO is a Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plan. A Special Needs Plan has a network made up of doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, providers of long-term services and supports, and other providers. It also has Care Coordinators and care teams to help you manage all your providers and services. They all work together to provide the care you need.
HealthPartners MSHO was approved by the State of Minnesota and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide you services as part of Minnesota Senior Health Options (MSHO).
MSHO is a demonstration program jointly run by Minnesota and the federal government to provide better health care for people who have both Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid). Under this demonstration, the state and federal government want to test new ways to improve how you get your Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid) health care services.
B. Information about Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid)
B1. Medicare
Medicare is the federal health insurance program for:
• people 65 years of age or older,
• some people under age 65 with certain disabilities, and
• people with end-stage renal disease (kidney failure).
B2. Medical Assistance (Medicaid)
Medicaid is a program run by the federal government and the state that helps people with limited incomes and resources pay for long-term services and supports and medical costs. It covers extra services and drugs not covered by Medicare. In Minnesota, Medicaid is called Medical Assistance.
Each state decides:
• what counts as income and resources,
• who qualifies,
• what services are covered, and
• the cost for services.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.

States can decide how to run their programs, as long as they follow the federal rules.
Medicare and Minnesota must approve HealthPartners MSHO each year. You can get Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid) services through our plan as long as:
• we choose to offer the plan, and
• Medicare and the State of Minnesota approve the plan.
Even if our plan stops operating in the future, your eligibility for Medicare and Medical Assistance
(Medicaid) services will not be affected.
C. Advantages of this plan
You will now get all your covered Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid) services from HealthPartners MSHO, including prescription drugs. You do not pay extra to join this health plan.

• You will be able to direct your own care with help from your care team and Care Coordinator.

 J. Other information you will get from us
You should have a HealthPartners MSHO Member ID Card, information about how to access or get a Provider and Pharmacy Directory and information about how to access a List of Covered Drugs (Drug List).

Under our plan, you will have one card for your Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid) services, including long-term services and supports and prescriptions. You must show this card when you get any services or prescriptions. Here’s a sample card to show you what yours will look like:
  If your card is damaged, lost, or stolen, call Member Services right away and we will send you a new card.
As long as you are a member of our plan, you do not need to use your red, white, and blue Medicare card or your Medical Assistance (Medicaid) card to get services. Keep those cards in a safe place, in case you need them later. If you show your Medicare card instead of your HealthPartners MSHO Member ID Card, the provider may bill Medicare instead of our plan, and you may get a bill. See Chapter 7, section A to see what to do if you get a bill from a provider.

You can ask for a Provider and Pharmacy Directory by calling Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page. You can also see the Provider and Pharmacy Directory at healthpartners.com/msho or download it from this website.

J4. The Explanation of Benefits
When you use your Part D prescription drug benefits, we will send you a summary report to help you understand and keep track of payments for your Part D prescription drugs. This summary report is called the Explanation of Benefits (or EOB).
The EOB tells you the total amount you, or others on your behalf, have spent on your Part D prescription drugs and the total amount we have paid for each of your Part D prescription drugs during the month. The EOB has more information about the drugs you take. Chapter 6 gives more information about the EOB and how it can help you keep track of your drug coverage.
An EOB is also available when you ask for one. To get a copy, contact Member Services.
K. How to keep your membership record up to date
You can keep your membership record up to date by letting us know when your information changes.
The plan’s network providers and pharmacies need to have the right information about you. They use your membership record to know what services and drugs you get and how much it will cost you. Because of this, it is very important that you help us keep your information up-to-date.
Let us know the following:
• Changes to your name, your address, or your phone number
• Changes in any other health insurance coverage, such as from your employer, your spouse’s employer, or workers’ compensation

EOC-200.16-MSHO 30

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 3: Using the plan’s coverage for your health care and other covered services
A. Information about “services,” “covered services,” “providers,” and “network providers”
Services are health care, long-term services and supports, supplies, behavioral health, prescription and over-the-counter drugs, equipment and other services. Covered services are any of these services that our plan pays for. Covered health care and long-term services and supports are listed in the Benefits Chart in Chapter 4, section D.
Providers are doctors, nurses, and other people who give you services and care. The term providers also includes hospitals, home health agencies, clinics, and other places that give you health care services, medical equipment, and long-term services and supports.
Network providers are providers who work with the health plan. These providers have agreed to accept our payment and your cost-sharing amount as full payment. Network providers bill us directly for care they give you. When you see a network provider, you usually pay only your share of the cost for covered services.
B. Rules for getting your health care, behavioral health, and long-term services and supports (LTSS) covered by the plan
HealthPartners MSHO covers all services covered by Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid). This includes behavioral health and long-term services and supports.
HealthPartners MSHO will generally pay for the health care and services you get if you follow plan rules. To be covered by our plan:
• The care you get must be a plan benefit. This means that it must be included in the plan’s Benefits Chart. (The chart is in Chapter 4, section D of this handbook).
• The care must be medically necessary. Medically necessary describes the services, supplies, or drugs you need to prevent, diagnose, or treat your medical condition or to maintain your current health status. This includes care that keeps you from going into a hospital or nursing home. It also means the services, supplies, or drugs meet accepted standards of medical practice.
o Medically necessary care is appropriate for your condition. This includes care related to physical conditions and mental health. It includes the kind and level of services. It includes the number of treatments. It also includes where you get the services and how long they continue. Medically necessary services must:
− be the services that other providers would usually order.
− help you get better or stay as well as you are.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 3: Using the plan’s coverage for your health care and other covered services
− help stop your condition from getting worse.
− help prevent and find health problems.
• You must have a network primary care provider (PCP) who has ordered the care or has told you to see another doctor. As a plan member, you must choose a network provider to be your PCP.
o In most cases, your network PCP must give you approval before you can see someone that is not your PCP or use other providers in the plan’s network. This is called a referral. If you don’t get approval, HealthPartners MSHO may not cover the services. You don’t need a referral to see certain specialists, such as women’s health specialists. To learn more about referrals, see Section D1.
o You do not need a referral from your PCP for emergency care or urgently needed care or to see a woman’s health provider. You can get other kinds of care without having a referral from your PCP. To learn more about this, see Section D1.
o To learn more about choosing a PCP, see Section D2.
• You must get your care from network providers. Usually, the plan will not cover care from a provider who does not work with the health plan. Here are some cases when this rule does not apply:
o The plan covers emergency or urgently needed care from an out-of-network provider. To learn more and to see what emergency or urgently needed care means, see section H.
o If you need care that our plan covers and our network providers cannot give it to you, you can get the care from an out-of-network provider. In this situation, we will cover the care as if you got it from a network provider. To learn about getting approval to see an out-of- network provider, see Section D4.
o The plan covers kidney dialysis services when you are outside the plan’s service area for a short time. You can get these services at a Medicare-certified dialysis facility.
o When you first join the plan, you can continue seeing the providers you see now for up to 120 days for the following reasons:
− An acute condition.
− A life-threatening mental or physical illness.
− A physical or mental disability defined as an inability to engage in one or more major life activities. This applies to a disability that has lasted or is expected to last at least one year, or is likely to result in death.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711.

− A disabling or chronic condition that is in an acute phase.
− You are receiving culturally appropriate health care services (excluding transportation services) and the plan does not have a network provider with special expertise in the delivery of those culturally appropriate health care services.
− You do not speak English and the plan does not have a network provider who can communicate with you, either directly or through an interpreter.
If your qualified health care provider certifies that you have an expected lifetime of 180 days or less, you may be able to continue to use services for the rest of your life from a provider who is no longer part of our network.
An exception is made for family planning, which is an open access service covered by us through Medical Assistance (Medicaid). Federal and state law let you choose any provider, even if not in our network, to get certain family planning services from. This means any doctor, clinic, hospital, pharmacy, or family planning office. For more information see the “Family Planning Services” section of the Benefits Chart in Chapter 4.
C. Information about your Care Coordinator
C1. What a Care Coordinator is
A care coordinator is a person who develops and coordinates supports and services stated in the care plan. A Care Coordinator is a Registered Nurse or Licensed Social Worker who provides a free and confidential service to you. You will be contacted by your Care Coordinator shortly after you enroll. Your Care Coordinator will schedule a time to complete a health risk assessment with you and/or your caregiver(s) and will share the results of your assessment. Together you will develop your care plan, which includes any services and/or supports you or your caregiver(s) may be eligible to receive in order to meet your needs. Your Care Coordinator will help arrange those services and supports and make sure they are meeting your needs according to your care plan. When you experience a hospitalization, your Care Coordinator will work with you and/or caregiver(s) and your care team to provide the needed support to make sure you have a safe and successful transition back home or to a setting that will meet your needs. They will also work with your doctors and care team to help you self-manage your chronic health conditions and reach your health care goals. Your Care Coordinator will follow up with you as needed and at least once a year to complete another health risk assessment and to update your care plan including services and supports if your needs and health care goals have changed.

D. Care from primary care providers, specialists, other network providers, and out-of-network providers
D1. Care from a primary care provider
You must choose a primary care provider (PCP) to provide and manage your care.
Definition of a “PCP,” and what a PCP does for you
When you become a member of our plan, you must choose a plan provider to be your PCP. Your PCP is a physician, nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant who meets state requirements and is trained to give you basic medical care. You will get your routine or basic care from your PCP. Your PCP will also coordinate the rest of the covered services you get as a member of our plan. Your PCP will provide most of your care and will help you arrange or coordinate the rest of the covered services you get as a member of our plan. This includes your x-rays, laboratory tests, therapies, care from doctors who are specialists, hospital admissions, and follow-up care.
“Coordinating” your services includes checking or consulting with other plan providers about your care and how it is going. You must get approval in advance from your PCP (such as giving you a referral to see a specialist). Since your PCP will provide and coordinate your medical you should have all of your past medical records sent to your PCP’s office. Chapter 8, Section C, tells you how we will protect the privacy of your medical records and personal health information.
Your choice of PCP
When you enroll in our plan, you need to select a clinic. You need to receive care from a PCP who is located at your clinic. You can choose a PCP by using the Provider and Pharmacy Directory or getting help from Member Services. You need to communicate to HealthPartners which PCP you choose on your application form. If there is a particular plan specialist or hospital that you want to use, check first to be sure your PCP uses that specialist or hospital. You can change your PCP, as explained under the heading “Option to change your PCP” in the next section. The name and office telephone number of your PCP is printed on your member ID card.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
  EOC-200.16-MSHO 34

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 3: Using the plan’s coverage for your health care and other covered services
Option to change your PCP
You may change your PCP for any reason, at any time during the year. Also, it’s possible that your PCP might leave our plan’s network. We can help you find a new PCP if the one you have now leaves our network.
To change your PCP, call Member Services at the phone number at the bottom of the page. They can assist you in finding and selecting another provider within our network. When you have decided on a new provider, Member Services will send the information to our enrollment department. They will update your member record and a new member ID card will be sent to you. In most cases, your new provider will be effective on the first day of the month following the date the request is received by our enrollment department. Please review the card to verify that the provider listed on the new member ID card is the one you chose.
Services you can get without first getting approval from your PCP
In most cases, you will need approval from your PCP before seeing other providers. This approval is called a referral. You can get services like the ones listed below without first getting approval from your PCP:
• Emergency services from network providers or out-of-network providers.
• Urgently needed care from network providers.
• Urgently needed care from out-of-network providers when you can’t get to network providers (for example, when you are outside the plan’s service area).
• Kidney dialysis services that you get at a Medicare-certified dialysis facility when you are outside the plan’s service area. (Please call Member Services before you leave the service area. We can help you get dialysis while you are away.)
• Flu shots, hepatitis B vaccinations, and pneumonia vaccinations as long as you get them from a network provider.
• Routine women’s health care and family planning services. This includes breast exams, screening mammograms (x-rays of the breast), Pap tests, and pelvic exams as long as you get them from a network provider.
• Additionally, if you are eligible to get services from Indian health providers, you may see these providers without a referral.

 EOC-200.16-MSHO 35

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 3: Using the plan’s coverage for your health care and other covered services
D2. Care from specialists and other network providers
A specialist is a doctor who provides health care for a specific disease or part of the body. There are many kinds of specialists. Here are a few examples:
• Oncologists care for patients with cancer.
• Cardiologists care for patients with heart problems.
• Orthopedists care for patients with bone, joint, or muscle problems.
Each primary care clinic has a network of preferred specialists and hospitals it works with. You may need a referral to see a specialist or someone that is not your PCP. A referral means that your network PCP must give you approval before you can see the other provider. If you don’t get a referral, HealthPartners MSHO may not cover the service. Talk to your PCP or call Member Services to see if you need a referral to a specialist.
Some of the services or drugs covered by HealthPartners MSHO are covered only if your doctor or other network provider gets approval from HealthPartners first. This is called a prior authorization. See the Benefits Chart in Chapter 4, section D for information about which services require a prior authorization.
A written referral may be for one visit or it may be a standing referral for more than one visit if you need ongoing services. We must give you a standing referral to a qualified specialist for any of these conditions:
• A chronic (on-going) condition;
• A life-threatening mental or physical illness;
• A degenerative disease or disability;
• Any other condition or disease that is serious or complex enough to require treatment by a specialist.
If you do not get a written referral when needed, the bill may not be paid. For more information, call Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page.
 If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 3: Using the plan’s coverage for your health care and other covered services
D3. What to do when a provider leaves our plan
A network provider you are using might leave our plan. If one of your providers does leave our plan, you have certain rights and protections that are summarized below:
• Even though our network of providers may change during the year, we must give you uninterrupted access to qualified providers.
• We will make a good faith effort to give you at least 30 days’ notice so that you have time to select a new provider.
• We will help you select a new qualified provider to continue managing your health care needs.
• If you are undergoing medical treatment, you have the right to ask, and we will work with you to ensure, that the medically necessary treatment you are getting is not interrupted.
• If you believe we have not replaced your previous provider with a qualified provider or that your care is not being appropriately managed, you have the right to file an appeal of our decision.
If you find out one of your providers is leaving our plan, please contact us so we can assist you in finding a new provider and managing your care. For more information, call Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page.
If a provider you choose is no longer in our plan network, you must choose another plan network provider. You may be able to continue to use services from a provider no longer a part of our plan network for up to 120 days for the following reasons:
• An acute condition
• A life-threatening mental or physical illness
• A physical or mental disability defined as an inability to engage in one or more major life activities. This applies to a disability that has lasted or is expected to last at least one year, or is likely to result in death.
• A disabling or chronic condition that is in an acute phase
If your qualified health care provider certifies that you have an expected lifetime of 180 days or less, you may be able to continue to use services for the rest of your life from a provider who is no longer part of our network.

 EOC-200.16-MSHO 37

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 3: Using the plan’s coverage for your health care and other covered services
D4. How to get care from out-of-network providers
Out-of-network providers are providers that are not part of the network. If you use out-of-network providers, we may not cover your services. We cover certain health care services that you get from out-of-network providers. These include care for a medical emergency, including hospital care after you are stable (known as post-stabilization), maintenance care, urgently needed care when you are temporarily out of the service area, care that has been approved in advance by HealthPartners and any services which were determined to be covered through an appeals process.
The exceptions to this rule are when you need urgent or emergency care or dialysis and cannot get to a provider in the plan, such as when you are away from home. You can also go outside the plan for other nonemergency services if HealthPartners MSHO gives you permission first.
An authorization for out-of-network services must be approved prior to receiving services. If you have questions regarding obtaining an authorization, you may contact your primary care provider or call Member Services.
If you go to an out-of-network provider, the provider must be eligible to participate in Medicare and/or Medical Assistance (Medicaid).
• We cannot pay a provider who is not eligible to participate in Medicare and/or Medical Assistance (Medicaid).
• If you go to a provider who is not eligible to participate in Medicare, you must pay the full cost of the services you get.
• Providers must tell you if they are not eligible to participate in Medicare. E. How to get long-term services and supports (LTSS)
Members have access to long-term services and supports through their Care Coordinator. Together with their Care Coordinator, members complete a health risk assessment to identify their individual needs. Collaboratively the member and Care Coordinator create an individualized care plan that will support the identified needs of the member. Care Coordinators proceed with coordinating the long- term services and supports to support the member’s identified needs and care plan goals. Members may call their Care Coordinator or Member Services to request LTSS.
F. How to get behavioral health services
Members can contact Member Services or the Behavioral Health Navigators for assistance in finding a network behavioral health provider. If you know who you want as a provider and need an authorization, you must call HealthPartners Behavioral Health Triage line at 952-883-7501.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711.

G. How to get transportation services
If you need transportation to and from health services that we cover, call 952-883-7400 or 888-288-1439 (toll free). We will provide the most appropriate and cost-effective transportation. We are not required to provide transportation to your Primary Care Clinic if it is over 30 miles from your home or if you choose a specialty provider that is more than 60 miles from your home. Call 952-883-7400 or 888-288-1439 (toll free) if you do not have a Primary Care Clinic that is available within 30 miles of your home and/or if it is over 60 miles to your specialty provider.
H. How to get covered services when you have a medical emergency or urgent need for care, or during a disaster
H1. Care when you have a medical emergency Definition of a medical emergency
A medical emergency is a medical condition with symptoms such as severe pain or serious injury. The condition is so serious that, if it doesn’t get immediate medical attention, you or anyone with an average knowledge of health and medicine could expect it to result in:
• serious risk to your health; or
• serious harm to bodily functions; or
• serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.
What to do if you have a medical emergency
If you have a medical emergency:
• Get help as fast as possible. Call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room or hospital. Call for an ambulance if you need it. You do not need to get approval or a referral first from your PCP .
• As soon as possible, make sure that you tell our plan about your emergency. We need to follow up on your emergency care. You or someone else should call to tell us about your emergency care, usually within 48 hours. However, you will not have to pay for emergency services because of a delay in telling us. Call the number on the back of the plan’s Member ID Card).
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
   EOC-200.16-MSHO 39

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 3: Using the plan’s coverage for your health care and other covered services
Covered services in a medical emergency
You may get covered emergency care whenever you need it, anywhere in the United States or its territories. If you need an ambulance to get to the emergency room, our plan covers that. To learn more, see the Benefits Chart in Chapter 4, section D. Our plan does not cover emergency medical care that you get outside the United States and its territories.
If you have an emergency, we will talk with the doctors who give you emergency care. Those doctors will tell us when your medical emergency is over.
After the emergency is over, you may need follow-up care to be sure you get better. Your follow-up care will be covered by our plan. If you get your emergency care from out-of-network providers, we will try to get network providers to take over your care as soon as possible.
Getting emergency care if it wasn’t a medical emergency after all
Sometimes it can be hard to know if you have a medical or behavioral health emergency. You might go in for emergency care and have the doctor say it wasn’t really an emergency. As long as you reasonably thought your health was in serious danger, we will cover your care.
However, after the doctor says it was not an emergency, we will cover your additional care only if:
• you go to a network provider, or
• the additional care you get is considered “urgently needed care” and you follow the rules for getting this care. (See the next section.)
H2. Urgently needed care Definition of urgently needed care
Urgently needed care is care you get for a sudden illness, injury, or condition that isn’t an emergency but needs care right away. For example, you might have a flare-up of an existing condition and need to have it treated.
Urgently needed care when you are in the plan’s service area
In most situations, we will cover urgently needed care only if:
• you get this care from a network provider, and
• you follow the other rules described in this chapter.
However, if you can’t get to a network provider, we will cover urgently needed care you get from an out-of-network provider.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
 EOC-200.16-MSHO 40

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 3: Using the plan’s coverage for your health care and other covered services
For urgent care needs during clinic hours, please call your clinic. For urgent care after your clinic’s regular hours, you have several options:
• Call your clinic’s after-hours line, if one is available.
• Call the CareLineSM at 612-339-3663 or 800-551-0859 to speak to a registered nurse.
• Visit any urgent care clinic that’s in your Provider and Pharmacy Directory. Urgently needed care when you are outside the plan’s service area
When you are outside the plan’s service area, you might not be able to get care from a network provider. In that case, our plan will cover urgently needed care you get from any provider.
Our plan does not cover urgently needed care or any other care that you get outside the United States.
H3. Care during a disaster
If the Governor of your state, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the President of the United States declares a state of disaster or emergency in your geographic area, you are still entitled to care from HealthPartners MSHO.
Please visit our website for information on how to obtain needed care during a declared disaster: healthpartners.com/msho.
During a declared disaster, if you cannot use a network provider, we will allow you to get care from out-of-network providers at the in-network cost-sharing rate. If you cannot use a network pharmacy during a declared disaster, you will be able to fill your prescription drugs at an out-of-network pharmacy. Please see Chapter 5 for more information.
I. What to do if you are billed directly for services covered by our plan
We cannot pay you back for most medical bills that you pay. State and federal laws prevent us from paying you directly. The exception is if you pay for Part D prescription drugs. If you paid for a service that you think we should have covered, contact Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page.
We do not allow HealthPartners MSHO providers to bill you for these services. We pay our providers directly, and we protect you from any charges. If a provider sends you a bill instead of sending it to the plan, you can ask us to pay our share of the bill.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 3: Using the plan’s coverage for your health care and other covered services
You should not pay the bill yourself. If you do, the plan may not be able to pay you back.
If you have paid more than your share for Medicare Part D drugs or if you have gotten a bill for the full cost of covered medical services, see Chapter 7, section A to learn what to do.
I1. What to do if services are not covered by our plan
HealthPartners MSHO covers all services:
• that are medically necessary, and
• that are listed in the plan’s Benefits Chart (see Chapter 4, section D, page 52), and
• that you get by following plan rules.
If you get services that aren’t covered by our plan, you must pay the full cost yourself.
If you want to know if we will pay for any medical service or care, you have the right to ask us. You also have the right to ask for this in writing. If we say we will not pay for your services, you have the right to appeal our decision.
Chapter 9 explains what to do if you want the plan to cover a medical item or service. It also tells you how to appeal the plan’s coverage decision. You may also call Member Services to learn more about your appeal rights.
Some services are covered up to a certain limit. If you go over the benefit limit, you will have to pay the full cost to get more of that type of service. See Chapter 4 for specific benefit limits. Call Member Services to find out what the limits are and how close you are to reaching them.
J. Coverage of health care services when you are in a clinical research study
J1. Definition of a clinical research study
A clinical research study (also called a clinical trial) is a way doctors test new types of health care or drugs. They ask for volunteers to help with the study. This kind of study helps doctors decide whether a new kind of health care or drug works and whether it is safe.
Once Medicare approves a study you want to be in, someone who works on the study will contact you. That person will tell you about the study and see if you qualify to be in it. You can be in the study as long as you meet the required conditions. You must also understand and accept what you must do for the study.
While you are in the study, you may stay enrolled in our plan. That way you continue to get care from our plan not related to the study.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
  EOC-200.16-MSHO 42

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 3: Using the plan’s coverage for your health care and other covered services
If you want to participate in a Medicare-approved clinical research study, you do not need to get approval from us or your primary care provider. The providers that give you care as part of the study do not need to be network providers.
You do need to tell us before you start participating in a clinical research study. If you plan to be in a clinical research study, you or your Care Coordinator should contact Member Services to let us know you will be in a clinical trial.
J2. Payment for services when you are in a clinical research study
If you volunteer for a clinical research study that Medicare approves, you will pay nothing for the services covered under the study and Medicare will pay for services covered under the study as well as routine costs associated with your care. Once you join a Medicare-approved clinical research study, you are covered for most items and services you get as part of the study. This includes:
• Room and board for a hospital stay that Medicare would pay for even if you weren’t in a study.
• An operation or other medical procedure that is part of the research study.
• Treatment of any side effects and complications of the new care.
If you are part of a study that Medicare has not approved, you will have to pay any costs for being
in the study.
J3. Learning more about clinical research studies
You can learn more about joining a clinical research study by reading “Medicare & Clinical Research Studies” on the Medicare website (www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/02226-Medicare-and-Clinical- Research-Studies.pdf). You can also call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), 24 hours a day,
7 days a week. TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.
K. How your health care services are covered when you get care in a religious non-medical health care institution
K1. Definition of a religious non-medical health care institution
A religious non-medical health care institution is a place that provides care you would normally get in a hospital or skilled nursing facility. If getting care in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility is against your religious beliefs, we will cover care in a religious non-medical health care institution.
You may choose to get health care at any time for any reason. This benefit is only for Medicare Part A inpatient services (non-medical health care services). Medicare will only pay for non-medical health care services provided by religious non-medical health care institutions.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
    EOC-200.16-MSHO 43

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 3: Using the plan’s coverage for your health care and other covered services
K2. Getting care from a religious non-medical health care institution
To get care from a religious non-medical health care institution, you must sign a legal document that says you are against getting medical treatment that is “non-excepted.”
• “Non-excepted” medical treatment is any care that is voluntary and not required by any federal, state, or local law.
• “Excepted” medical treatment is any care that is not voluntary and is required under federal, state, or local law.
To be covered by our plan, the care you get from a religious non-medical health care institution must meet the following conditions:
• The facility providing the care must be certified by Medicare.
• Our plan’s coverage of services is limited to non-religious aspects of care.
• If you get services from this institution that are provided to you in a facility, the following applies:
o You must have a medical condition that would allow you to get covered services for inpatient hospital care or skilled nursing facility care.
o You must get approval from our plan before you are admitted to the facility or your stay will not be covered.
Medicare Inpatient Hospital coverage limits apply for this benefit. See the Benefits Chart in Chapter 4, section D.
L. Durable medical equipment (DME)
L1. DME as a member of our plan
DME means certain items ordered by a provider for use in your own home. Examples of these items are wheelchairs, crutches, powered mattress systems, diabetic supplies, hospital beds ordered by a provider for use in the home, intravenous (IV) infusion pumps, speech generating devices, oxygen equipment and supplies, nebulizers, and walkers.
You will always own certain items, such as prosthetics.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
  EOC-200.16-MSHO 44

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 3: Using the plan’s coverage for your health care and other covered services
In this section, we discuss DME you must rent. As a member of HealthPartners MSHO, however, you usually will not own DME, no matter how long you rent it.
In certain situations, we will transfer ownership of the DME item to you. Call Member Services to find out about the requirements you must meet and the papers you need to provide.
L2. DME ownership when you switch to Original Medicare or another Medicare Advantage plan
In the Original Medicare program, people who rent certain types of DME own it after 13 months. In a Medicare Advantage plan, the plan can set the number of months people must rent certain types of DME before they own it.
Note: You can find definitions of Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage Plans in Chapter 12. You can also find more information about them in the Medicare & You 2021 handbook. If you don’t have a copy of this booklet, you can get it at the Medicare website (www.medicare.gov/medicare- and-you) or by calling 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.
You will have to make 13 payments in a row under Original Medicare, or you will have to make the number of payments in a row set by the Medicare Advantage plan, to own the DME item if:
• you did not become the owner of the DME item while you were in our plan, and
• you leave our plan and get your Medicare benefits outside of any health plan in the
Original Medicare program or a Medicare Advantage plan.
If you made payments for the DME item under Original Medicare or a Medicare Advantage plan before you joined our plan, those Original Medicare or Medicare Advantage plan payments do not count toward the payments you need to make after leaving our plan.
• You will have to make 13 new payments in a row under Original Medicare or a number of new payments in a row set by the Medicare Advantage plan to own the DME item.
• There are no exceptions to this when you return to Original Medicare or a Medicare Advantage plan.
L3. Oxygen equipment benefits as a member of our plan
If you qualify for oxygen equipment covered by Medicare and you are a member of our plan, we will cover the following:
• Rental of oxygen equipment
• Delivery of oxygen and oxygen contents
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 3: Using the plan’s coverage for your health care and other covered services
• Tubing and related accessories for the delivery of oxygen and oxygen contents
• Maintenance and repairs of oxygen equipment
Oxygen equipment must be returned to the owner when it’s no longer medically necessary for you or
if you leave out plan.
L4. Oxygen equipment when you switch to Original Medicare or another Medicare Advantage plan
When oxygen equipment is medically necessary and you leave our plan and switch to Original Medicare, you will rent it from a supplier for 36 months. Your monthly rental payments cover oxygen equipment and the supplies and services listed above.
If oxygen equipment is medically necessary after you rent it for 36 months:
• your supplier must provide the oxygen equipment, supplies, and services for another 24
months.
• your supplier must provide oxygen equipment and supplies for up to 5 years if medically necessary.
If oxygen equipment is still medically necessary at the end of the 5-year period:
• your supplier no longer has to provide it, and you may choose to get replacement
equipment from any supplier.
• a new 5-year period begins.
• you will rent from a supplier for 36 months.
• your supplier must then provide the oxygen equipment, supplies, and services for another 24 months.
• a new cycle begins every 5 years as long as oxygen equipment is medically necessary.
When oxygen equipment is medically necessary and you leave our plan and switch to another Medicare Advantage plan, the plan will cover at least what Original Medicare covers. You can ask your new Medicare Advantage plan what oxygen equipment and supplies it covers and what your costs will be.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 4: Benefits Chart
 A. Your covered services and your out-of-pocket costs
This chapter tells you what services HealthPartners MSHO covers. You can also learn about services that are not covered. Information about drug benefits is in Chapter 5. This chapter also explains limits on some services.
Because you get assistance from Medical Assistance (Medicaid), you pay nothing for your covered services as long as you follow the plan’s rules. See Chapter 3, section B for details about the plan’s rules.
If you need help understanding what services are covered, call Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page.
B. Rules against providers charging you for services
We do not allow HealthPartners MSHO providers to bill you for covered services. We pay our providers directly, and we protect you from any charges. This is true even if we pay the provider less than the provider charges for a service.
You should never get a bill from a provider for covered services. If you do, see Chapter 7 or call Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page.
C. Our plan’s Benefits Chart
The Benefits Chart in Section D tells you which services the plan pays for. It lists categories of services in alphabetical order and explains the covered services.
We will pay for the services listed in the Benefits Chart only when the following rules are met.
You do not pay anything for the services listed in the Benefits Chart, as long as you meet the coverage requirements described below.
• Your Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid) covered services must be provided according to the rules set by Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid).
• The services (including medical care, services, supplies, equipment, and drugs) must be medically necessary. Medically necessary means services, supplies, or drugs you need to prevent, diagnose, or treat your medical condition or to maintain your current health status. This includes care that keeps you from going into a hospital or nursing home. It also means the services, supplies, or drugs meet accepted standards of medical practice.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 4: Benefits Chart
• Medically necessary care is appropriate for your condition. This includes care related to physical conditions and mental health. It includes the kind and level of services. It includes the number of treatments. It also includes where you get the services and how long they continue. Medically necessary services must:
o be the services, supplies and prescription drugs that other providers would usually order. o help you get better or stay as well as you are.
o help stop your condition from getting worse.
o help prevent and find health problems.
• You get your care from a network provider. A network provider is a provider who works with the health plan. In most cases, the plan will not pay for care you get from an out-of-network provider. Chapter 3 has more information about using network and out-of-network providers.
• You have a primary care provider (PCP) or a care team that is providing and managing your care. In most cases, your PCP must give you approval before you can see someone that is not your PCP or use other providers in the plan’s network. This is called a referral. Chapter 3, section D has more information about getting a referral and explains when you do not need a referral.
• Some of the services listed in the Benefits Chart are covered only if your doctor or other network provider gets approval from us first. This is called prior authorization. Covered services that need prior authorization are marked in the Benefits Chart by an asterisk (*).

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 4: Benefits Chart
C1. Restricted Recipient Program
• The Restricted Recipient Program is a program for members who have misused health services. This includes getting health services that members did not need or using them in a way that costs more than they should. HealthPartners will notify members if they are placed in the Restricted Recipient Program.
• If you are in the Restricted Recipient Program, you must get health services from one designated primary care provider in your local trade area, one clinic, one hospital used by the primary care provider, and one pharmacy. HealthPartners may designate other health care providers. You may also be assigned to a home health agency. You may not be allowed to use the personal care assistance choice or flexible use options or consumer directed services.
• You will be restricted to these designated health care providers for at least 24 months of eligibility for Minnesota Health Care Programs (MHCP). All referrals to specialists must be from your primary care provider, and received by the HealthPartners Restricted Recipient Program. Restricted recipients may not pay out-of-pocket to see a non-designated provider who is the same provider type as one of their designated providers.
• Placement in the program will stay with you if you change health plans. Placement in the program will also stay with you if you change to MHCP fee-for-service. You will not lose eligibility for MHCP because of placement in the program.
• At the end of the 24 months, your use of health care services will be reviewed. If you still misused health services, you will be placed in the program for an additional 36 months of eligibility.
• You have the right to appeal placement in the Restricted Recipient Program. You must file an appeal within 60 days from the date on the notice from us. You must appeal within 30 days to prevent the restriction from being implemented during your appeal. A member may request a state appeal after receiving our decision that we will enforce the restriction. See Chapter 9, section E4, for more information about your right to appeal.
• The Restricted Recipient Program does not apply to Medicare-covered services. If you use opioid medications that you get from several doctors or pharmacies, we may talk to your doctors to make sure your use is appropriate and medically necessary. Working with your doctors, if we decide your use of prescription opioid or benzodiazepine medications is not safe, we may limit how you can get those medications. See Chapter 5, Section G3 for more information.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 5: Getting your outpatient prescription drugs through the plan
Chapter 5: Getting your outpatient prescription drugs through the plan
Introduction
This chapter explains rules for getting your outpatient prescription drugs. These are drugs that your provider orders for you that you get from a pharmacy or by mail-order. They include drugs covered under Medicare Part D and Medical Assistance (Medicaid). Chapter 6, section D tells you what you pay for these drugs. Key terms and their definitions appear in alphabetical order in the last chapter of the Member Handbook.
HealthPartners MSHO also covers the following drugs, although they will not be discussed in this chapter:
• Drugs covered by Medicare Part A. These include some drugs given to you while you are in a hospital or nursing facility.
• Drugs covered by Medicare Part B. These include some chemotherapy drugs, some drug injections given to you during an office visit with a doctor or other provider, and drugs you are given at a dialysis clinic. To learn more about what Medicare Part B drugs are covered, see the Benefits Chart in Chapter 4, section D.
• In addition to the plan’s Medicare Part D and medical benefits coverage, your drugs may be covered by Original Medicare if you are in Medicare hospice. For more information, please see Chapter 5, Section F “If you are in a Medicare-certified hospice program.”
Rules for the plan’s outpatient drug coverage
The plan will usually cover your drugs as long as you follow the rules in this section.
1. You must have a doctor or other provider write your prescription. This person often is your primary care provider (PCP). It could also be another provider if your primary care provider has referred you for care.
2. Your prescriber must either accept Medicare or file documentation with CMS showing that he or she is qualified to write prescriptions. You should ask your prescribers the next time you call or visit if they meet this condition.
3. You generally must use a network pharmacy to fill your prescription.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
  EOC-200.16-MSHO 110

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 5: Getting your outpatient prescription drugs through the plan
4. Your prescribed drug must be on the plan’s List of Covered Drugs. We call it the “Drug List” for short.
• If it is not on the Drug List, we may be able to cover it by giving you an exception.
• See Section D, “Reasons your drug might not be covered,” to learn about asking for an
exception.
5. Your drug must be used for a medically accepted indication. This means that the use of the drug is either approved by the Food and Drug Administration or supported by certain medical references.
 If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711.

 A. Getting your prescriptions filled
A1. Filling your prescription at a network pharmacy
In most cases, the plan will pay for prescriptions only if they are filled at the plan’s network pharmacies. A network pharmacy is a drug store that has agreed to fill prescriptions for our plan members. You may go to any of our network pharmacies.
To find a network pharmacy, you can look in the Provider and Pharmacy Directory, visit our website, or contact Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page.
You can get a print copy of the Provider and Pharmacy Directory by calling Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page.
At any time, you can get up-to-date information about changes in the pharmacy network on our website at healthpartners.com/msho.
A2. Using your Member ID Card when you fill a prescription
To fill your prescription, show your Member ID Card at your network pharmacy. The network pharmacy will bill the plan for our share of the cost of your covered prescription drug. You may need to pay the pharmacy a copay when you pick up your prescription.
If you do not have your Member ID Card with you when you fill your prescription, ask the pharmacy to call the plan to get the necessary information.
If the pharmacy is not able to get the necessary information, you may have to pay the full cost of the prescription when you pick it up. You can then ask us to pay you back for our share. If you cannot pay for the drug, contact Member Services right away. We will do what we can to help.
• To learn how to ask us to pay you back, see Chapter 7, section B.
NOTE: If the drug is covered by Medical Assistance (Medicaid), we do not allow HealthPartners MSHO providers to bill you for these drugs. We pay our providers directly, and we protect you from any charges. This is true even if we pay the provider less than the provider charges. If you paid for a drug that you think we should have covered, contact Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page.
• If you need help getting a prescription filled, you can contact Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
 EOC-200.16-MSHO 114

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 5: Getting your outpatient prescription drugs through the plan
A3. What to do if you change to a different network pharmacy
If you change pharmacies and need a refill of a prescription, you can either ask to have a new prescription written by a provider or ask your pharmacy to transfer the prescription to the new pharmacy if there are any refills left.
If you need help changing your network pharmacy, you can contact Member Services.
A4. What to do if your pharmacy leaves the network
If the pharmacy you use leaves the plan’s network, you will have to find a new network pharmacy.
To find a new network pharmacy, you can look in the Provider and Pharmacy Directory, visit our website, or contact Member Services.
A5. Using a specialized pharmacy
Sometimes prescriptions must be filled at a specialized pharmacy. Specialized pharmacies include:
• Pharmacies that supply drugs for home infusion therapy.
• Pharmacies that supply drugs for residents of a long-term care facility, such as a nursing home.
o Usually, long-term care facilities have their own pharmacies. If you are a resident of a long-term care facility, we must make sure you can get the drugs you need at the facility’s pharmacy.
o If your long-term care facility’s pharmacy is not in our network, or you have any difficulty accessing your drug benefits in a long-term care facility, please contact Member Services.
• Pharmacies that serve the Indian Health Service/Tribal/Urban Indian Health Program. Except in emergencies, only Native Americans or Alaska Natives may use these pharmacies.
• Pharmacies that supply drugs requiring special handling and instructions on their use. To find a specialized pharmacy, you can look in the Provider and Pharmacy Directory, visit our
website, or contact Member Services.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 5: Getting your outpatient prescription drugs through the plan
A6. Using mail-order services to get your drugs
For certain kinds of drugs, you can use the plan’s network mail-order services. Generally, the drugs available through mail-order are drugs that you take on a regular basis for a chronic or long-term medical condition. The drugs available through our plan’s mail-order service are marked as mail- order drugs in our Drug List.
Our plan’s mail-order service requires you to order a 90-day supply. A 90-day supply has the same copay as a one-month supply.
Filling my prescriptions by mail
To get information about filling your prescriptions by mail, call WellDyneRx Member Services at 800- 591-0011 (TTY: 711). They are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Usually, a mail-order prescription will get to you within 7 to 10 days. If your mail-order drug is delayed, you may request that the drug be sent to a retail pharmacy near you. At that time a full month supply of the drug will be filled. You will be charged the copay that applies.
Mail-order processes
The mail-order service has different procedures for new prescriptions it gets from you, new prescriptions it gets directly from your provider’s office, and refills on your mail-order prescriptions:
1. New prescriptions the pharmacy gets from you
The pharmacy will automatically fill and deliver new prescriptions it gets from you.
2. New prescriptions the pharmacy gets directly from your provider’s office
After the pharmacy gets a prescription from a health care provider, it will contact you to see if you want the medication filled immediately or at a later time.
• This will give you an opportunity to make sure the pharmacy is delivering the correct drug (including strength, amount, and form) and, if needed, allow you to stop or delay the order before you are billed and it is shipped.
• It is important that you respond each time you are contacted by the pharmacy, to let them know what to do with the new prescription and to prevent any delays in shipping.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
 EOC-200.16-MSHO 116

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 5: Getting your outpatient prescription drugs through the plan
3. Refills on mail-order prescriptions
For refills, please contact your pharmacy 20 days before you think the drugs you have on hand will run out to make sure your next order is shipped to you in time.
So the pharmacy can reach you to confirm your order before shipping, please make sure to let the pharmacy know the best ways to contact you. Because we communicate with you through your mail-order pharmacy, please contact that pharmacy to inform them how you would prefer to be contacted.
A7. Getting a long-term supply of drugs
You can get a long-term supply of maintenance drugs on our plan’s Drug List. Maintenance drugs are drugs that you take on a regular basis, for a chronic or long-term medical condition.
Some network pharmacies allow you to get a long-term supply of maintenance drugs. A 90-day supply has the same copay as a one-month supply. To find which pharmacies can give you a long- term supply of maintenance drugs, you can look in the Provider and Pharmacy Directory, visit our website, or contact Member Services at the number at the bottom of the page.
For certain kinds of drugs, you can use the plan’s network mail-order services to get a long-term supply of maintenance drugs. See the section above to learn about mail-order services.
A8. Using a pharmacy that is not in the plan’s network
Generally, we pay for drugs filled at an out-of-network pharmacy only when you are not able to use a network pharmacy. We have network pharmacies outside of our service area where you can get your prescriptions filled as a member of our plan.
We will pay for prescriptions filled at an out-of-network pharmacy in the following cases:
• If you need a prescription because of a medical emergency
We will cover up to a 30-day supply of prescriptions that are filled at an out-of-network pharmacy if the prescriptions are related to care for a medical emergency or urgently needed care.
• If you need a prescription when you travel or are away from the plan’s service area
If you take a prescription drug on a regular basis and you are going on a trip, be sure to check your supply of the drug before you leave. When possible, take along all the medication you will need. You may be able to order your prescription drugs ahead of time through our network mail-order pharmacy service or through a retail network pharmacy that offers an extended supply.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
 EOC-200.16-MSHO 117

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 5: Getting your outpatient prescription drugs through the plan
If you are traveling within the U.S. but outside of the plan’s service area, and you become ill, lose or run out of your prescription drugs, we will cover prescriptions that are filled at an our- of-network pharmacy if you follow all other coverage rules identified within this document and a network pharmacy is not available.
Prior to filling your prescription at an out-of-network pharmacy, call our Member Services or check our website (healthpartners.com/msho) to find out if there is a network pharmacy in the area where you are traveling. If there are no network pharmacies in that area, our Member Services may be able to make arrangements for you to get your prescriptions from an out-of-network pharmacy.
We cannot pay for any prescriptions that are filled by pharmacies outside the United States, even for a medical emergency.
• Other times you can get your prescription covered if you go to an out-of-network pharmacy
We will cover your prescription at an out-of-network pharmacy if at least one of the following applies:
o If you are unable to get a covered drug in a timely manner within our service area because there are no network pharmacies within a reasonable driving distance that provide 24-hour service.
o If you are trying to fill a covered prescription drug that is not regularly stocked at a network retail or mail-order pharmacy (these drugs include orphan drugs or other specialty pharmaceuticals).
In these cases, please check first with Member Services to see if there is a network pharmacy nearby.
A9. Paying you back if you pay for a prescription
If you must use an out-of-network pharmacy, you will generally have to pay the full cost instead of a copay when you get your prescription. You can ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost.
To learn more about this, see Chapter 7, section A.
NOTE: If the drug is covered by Medical Assistance (Medicaid), we do not allow HealthPartners MSHO providers to bill you for these drugs. We pay our providers directly, and we protect you from any charges. This is true even if we pay the provider less than the provider charges. If you paid for a drug that you think we should have covered, contact Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 5: Getting your outpatient prescription drugs through the plan
 B. The plan’s Drug List
The plan has a List of Covered Drugs. We call it the “Drug List” for short.
The drugs on the Drug List are selected by the plan with the help of a team of doctors and
pharmacists. The Drug List also tells you if there are any rules you need to follow to get your drugs.
We will generally cover a drug on the plan’s Drug List as long as you follow the rules explained in this chapter.
B1. Drugs on the Drug List
The Drug List includes the drugs covered under Medicare Part D and those covered under Medical Assistance (Medicaid).
The Drug List includes both brand name and generic drugs. Generic drugs have the same active ingredients as brand name drugs. Generally, they work just as well as brand name drugs and usually cost less.
Our plan also covers certain over-the-counter drugs and products. Some over-the-counter drugs cost less than prescription drugs and work just as well. For more information, call Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page.
B2. How to find a drug on the Drug List
To find out if a drug you are taking is on the Drug List, you can:
• Check the most recent Drug List.
• Visit the plan’s website at healthpartners.com/msho. The Drug List on the website is always the most current one.
• Call Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page to find out if a drug is on the plan’s Drug List or to ask for a copy of the list.
B3. Drugs that are not on the Drug List
The plan does not cover all prescription drugs. Some drugs are not on the Drug List because the law does not allow the plan to cover those drugs. In other cases, we have decided not to include a drug on the Drug List.
HealthPartners MSHO will not pay for the drugs listed in this section. These are called excluded drugs. If you get a prescription for an excluded drug, you must pay for it yourself. If you think we should pay for an excluded drug because of your case, you can file an appeal. (To learn how to file an appeal, see Chapter 9, section F5.)
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
 EOC-200.16-MSHO 119

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 5: Getting your outpatient prescription drugs through the plan
Here are three general rules for excluded drugs:
1. Our plan’s outpatient drug coverage (which includes Medicare Part D and Medicaid drugs) cannot pay for a drug that would be covered under Medicare Part A or Part B. See the introduction of this chapter for more information about Medicare Part A and Part B covered drugs. Drugs covered under Medicare Part A or Part B are covered by HealthPartners MSHO for free, but they are not considered part of your outpatient prescription drug benefits.
2. Our plan cannot cover a drug purchased outside the United States and its territories.
3. The use of the drug must be either approved by the Food and Drug Administration or supported by certain medical references as a treatment for your condition. Your doctor might prescribe a certain drug to treat your condition, even though it was not approved to treat the condition. This is called off-label use. Our plan usually does not cover drugs when they are prescribed for off- label use.
Also, by law, the types of drugs listed below are not covered by Medicare or Medical Assistance (Medicaid).
• Drugs used to promote fertility
• Drugs used for cosmetic purposes or to promote hair growth
• Drugs used for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction, such as Viagra®, Cialis®, Levitra®, and Caverject®
• Drugs used to promote weight loss
• Outpatient drugs, when the company who makes the drugs says that you have to have tests
or services done only by them
B4. Drug List cost-sharing tiers
Every drug on our plan’s Drug List is in a cost-sharing tier level. What you pay for a drug on the Drug List depends on whether the drug is a generic or brand name drug. Tier 1 generic drugs have the lowest copay. Tier 1 brand name drugs have a higher copay. Over-the-counter drugs and products have a $0 copay.
To find out the cost-sharing for your drug, look for the drug in our plan’s Drug List. Chapter 6, section D4 tells the amount you pay for drugs in each tier.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
 EOC-200.16-MSHO 120

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 5: Getting your outpatient prescription drugs through the plan
 C. Limits on some drugs
For certain prescription drugs, special rules limit how and when the plan covers them. In general, our rules encourage you to get a drug that works for your medical condition and is safe and effective. When a safe, lower-cost drug will work just as well as a higher-cost drug, the plan expects your provider to prescribe the lower-cost drug.
If there is a special rule for your drug, it usually means that you or your provider will have to take extra steps for us to cover the drug. For example, your provider may have to tell us your diagnosis or provide results of blood tests first. If you or your provider think our rule should not apply to your situation, you should ask us to make an exception. We may or may not agree to let you use the drug without taking the extra steps.
To learn more about asking for exceptions, see Chapter 9, section F3.
1. Limiting use of a brand name drug when a generic version is available
Generally, a generic drug works the same as a brand name drug and usually costs less. If there is a generic version of a brand-name drug, our network pharmacies will give you the generic version.
• We usually will not pay for the brand name drug when there is a generic version.
• However, if your provider has written “No substitutions” or “Dispense as written (DAW)” on
your prescription for a brand name drug, then we will cover the brand name drug.
• Your copay may be greater for the brand name drug than for the generic drug.
2. Getting plan approval in advance
For some drugs, you or your health care provider must get approval from HealthPartners MSHO before you fill your prescription. If you don’t get approval, HealthPartners MSHO may not cover the drug. This is called prior authorization.
3. Trying a different drug first
In general, the plan wants you to try lower-cost drugs (that often are as effective) before the plan covers drugs that cost more. For example, if Drug A and Drug B treat the same medical condition, and Drug A costs less than Drug B, the plan may require you to try Drug A first.
If Drug A does not work for you, the plan will then cover Drug B. This is called step therapy.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
 EOC-200.16-MSHO 121

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 5: Getting your outpatient prescription drugs through the plan
4. Quantity limits
For some drugs, we limit the amount of the drug you can have. This is called a quantity limit. For example, the plan might limit how much of a drug you can get each time you fill your prescription.
To find out if any of the rules above apply to a drug you take or want to take, check the Drug List. For the most up-to-date information, call Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page or check our website at healthpartners.com/msho.
D. Reasons your drug might not be covered
We try to make your drug coverage work well for you, but sometimes a drug might not be covered in the way that you would like it to be. For example:
• The drug you want to take is not covered by the plan. The drug might not be on the Drug List. A generic version of the drug might be covered, but the brand name version you want to take is not. A drug might be new and we have not yet reviewed it for safety and effectiveness.
• The drug is covered, but there are special rules or limits on coverage for that drug. As explained in the section above, some of the drugs covered by the plan have rules that limit their use. In some cases, you or your prescriber may want to ask us for an exception to a rule.
There are things you can do if your drug is not covered in the way that you would like it to be.
D1. Getting a temporary supply
In some cases, the plan can give you a temporary supply of a drug when the drug is not on the Drug List or when it is limited in some way. This gives you time to talk with your provider about getting a different drug or to ask the plan to cover the drug.
To get a temporary supply of a drug, you must meet the two rules below: 1. The drug you have been taking:
• is no longer on the plan’s Drug List, or

o Long-term care pharmacies may provide your prescription drug in small amounts at a time to prevent waste.
• You are new to the plan.
o We will cover a temporary supply of your drug during the first 90 days of your
membership in the plan.
o This temporary supply will be for up to 30 days.
o If your prescription is written for fewer days, we will allow multiple refills to provide up to a
maximum of 30 days of medication. You must fill the prescription at a network pharmacy.
o Long-term care pharmacies may provide your prescription drug in small amounts at a time to prevent waste.
• You have been in the plan for more than 90 days and live in a long-term care facility and need a supply right away.

We will grant early refills when appropriate.
Please note that this policy applies only to those drugs that are “Part D drugs” and bought at a network pharmacy. The policy can’t be used to buy a non-Part D drug or a drug out-of-network, unless you qualify for out-of-network access.

o To ask for a temporary supply of a drug, call Member Services.
When you get a temporary supply of a drug, you should talk with your provider to decide
what to do when your supply runs out. Here are your choices: • You can change to another drug.
There may be a different drug covered by the plan that works for you. You can call Member Services to ask for a list of covered drugs that treat the same medical condition. The list can help your provider find a covered drug that might work for you.
OR
To learn more about asking for an exception, see Chapter 9, section F3.
If you need help asking for an exception, you can contact Member Services
E. Changes in coverage for your drugs
Most changes in drug coverage happen on January 1, but HealthPartners MSHO may add or remove drugs on the Drug List during the year. We may also change our rules about drugs. For example, we could:
• Decide to require or not require prior approval for a drug. (Prior approval is permission from HealthPartners MSHO before you can get a drug.)
• Add or change the amount of a drug you can get (called quantity limits).
• Add or change step therapy restrictions on a drug. (Step therapy means you must try one
drug before we will cover another drug.)
For more information on these drug rules, see Section C earlier in this chapter.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
• You can ask for an exception.
You and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception. For example, you can ask the plan to cover a drug even though it is not on the Drug List. Or you can ask the plan to cover the drug without limits. If your provider says you have a good medical reason for an exception, he or she can help you ask for one.
  EOC-200.16-MSHO 124

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 5: Getting your outpatient prescription drugs through the plan
If you are taking a drug that was covered at the beginning of the year, we will generally not remove or change coverage of that drug during the rest of the year unless:
• a new, cheaper drug comes on the market that works as well as a drug on the Drug List now, or
• we learn that a drug is not safe, or
• a drug is removed from the market.
To get more information on what happens when the Drug List changes, you can always:
• Check HealthPartners MSHO’s up to date Drug List online at healthpartners.com/msho or
• Call Member Services to check the current Drug List at 888-820-4285. Some changes to the Drug List will happen immediately. For example:
• A new generic drug becomes available. Sometimes, a new generic drug comes on the market that works as well as a brand name drug on the Drug List now. When that happens, we may remove the brand name drug and add the new generic drug, but your cost for the new generic drug will stay the same or will be lower.
When we add the new generic drug, we may also decide to keep the brand name drug on the list but change its coverage rules or limits.
o We may not tell you before we make this change, but we will send you information about the specific change we made once it happens.
o You or your provider can ask for an “exception” from these changes. We will send you a notice with the steps you can take to ask for an exception. Please see Chapter 9 of this handbook for more information on exceptions.
• A drug is taken off the market. If the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says a drug you are taking is not safe or the drug’s manufacturer takes a drug off the market, we will take it off the Drug List. If you are taking the drug, we will let you know. You’ll want to talk to your pharmacist to see if your product is affected by the recall. If a replacement is needed, you can get a new prescription from your pharmacist. Call your doctor if you have questions about your prescription.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
 EOC-200.16-MSHO 125

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 5: Getting your outpatient prescription drugs through the plan
We may make other changes that affect the drugs you take. We will tell you in advance about these other changes to the Drug List. These changes might happen if:
• The FDA provides new guidance or there are new clinical guidelines about a drug.
• We add a generic drug that is not new to the market and
o Replace a brand name drug currently on the Drug List or
o Change the coverage rules or limits for the brand name drug. When these changes happen, we will:
• Tell you at least 30 days before we make the change to the Drug List or
• Let you know and give you a 30–day supply of the drug after you ask for a refill.
This will give you time to talk to your doctor or other prescriber. He or she can help you decide:
• If there is a similar drug on the Drug List you can take instead or
• Whether to ask for an exception from these changes. To learn more about asking for
exceptions, see Chapter 9, section F2.
We may make changes to drugs you take that do not affect you now. For such changes, if you are taking a drug we covered at the beginning of the year, we generally will not remove or change coverage of that drug during the rest of the year.
For example, if we remove a drug you are taking, increase what you pay for the drug, or limit its use, then the change will not affect your use of the drug or what you pay for the drug for the rest of the year.
F. Drug coverage in special cases
F1. If you are in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility for a stay that is covered by the plan
If you are admitted to a hospital or skilled nursing facility for a stay covered by the plan, we will generally cover the cost of your prescription drugs during your stay. You will not have to pay a copay. Once you leave the hospital or skilled nursing facility, the plan will cover your drugs as long as the drugs meet all of our rules for coverage.
To learn more about drug coverage and what you pay, see Chapter 6, section D4.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
  EOC-200.16-MSHO 126

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 5: Getting your outpatient prescription drugs through the plan
F2. If you are in a long-term care facility
Usually, a long-term care facility, such as a nursing home, has its own pharmacy or a pharmacy that supplies drugs for all of its residents. If you are living in a long-term care facility, you may get your prescription drugs through the facility’s pharmacy if it is part of our network.
To find out if your long-term care facility’s pharmacy is part of our network, you can look in the Provider and Pharmacy Directory, visit our website, or contact Member Services at the number at the bottom of the page. If it is not, or if you need more information, please contact Member Services.
F3. If you are in a Medicare-certified hospice program
Drugs are never covered by both hospice and our plan at the same time.
• If you are enrolled in a Medicare hospice and require a pain medication, anti-nausea, laxative, or antianxiety drug not covered by your hospice because it is unrelated to your terminal prognosis and related conditions, our plan must get notification from either the prescriber or your hospice provider that the drug is unrelated before our plan can cover the drug.
• To prevent delays in getting any unrelated drugs that should be covered by our plan, you can ask your hospice provider or prescriber to make sure we have the notification that the drug is unrelated before you ask a pharmacy to fill your prescription.
If you leave hospice, our plan should cover all of your drugs. To prevent any delays at a pharmacy when your Medicare hospice benefit ends, you should bring documentation to the pharmacy to verify that you have left hospice. See the previous parts of this chapter that tell about the rules for getting drug coverage under Part D.
To learn more about the hospice benefit, see Chapter 4, section D.
G. Programs on drug safety and managing drugs G1. Programs to help members use drugs safely
Each time you fill a prescription, we look for possible problems, such as drug errors or drugs that:
• May not be needed because you are taking another drug that does the same thing
• May not be safe for your age or gender
• Could harm you if you take them at the same time
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 5: Getting your outpatient prescription drugs through the plan
• Have ingredients that you are or may be allergic to
• Have unsafe amounts of opioid pain medications
If we see a possible problem in your use of prescription drugs, we will work with your provider to
correct the problem.
G2. Programs to help members manage their drugs
If you take medications for different medical conditions and/or are in a Drug Management Program to help you use your opioid medications safely, you may be eligible to get services, at no cost to you, through a medication therapy management (MTM) program. This program helps you and your provider make sure that your medications are working to improve your health. A pharmacist or other health professional will give you a comprehensive review of all your medications and talk with you about:
• How to get the most benefit from the drugs you take
• Any concerns you have, like medication costs and drug reactions
• How best to take your medications
• Any questions or problems you have about your prescription and over-the-counter medication
You’ll get a written summary of this discussion. The summary has a medication action plan that recommends what you can do to make the best use of your medications. You’ll also get a personal medication list that will include all the medications you’re taking and why you take them. In addition, you’ll get information about safe disposal of prescription medications that are controlled substances.
It’s a good idea to schedule your medication review before your yearly “Wellness” visit, so you can talk to your doctor about your action plan and medication list. Bring your action plan and medication list with you to your visit or anytime you talk with your doctors, pharmacists, and other health care providers. Also, take your medication list with you if you go to the hospital or emergency room.
Medication therapy management programs are voluntary and free to members who qualify. If we have a program that fits your needs, we will enroll you in the program and send you information. If you do not want to be in the program, please let us know, and we will take you out of the program.
If you have any questions about these programs, please contact Member Services.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 5: Getting your outpatient prescription drugs through the plan
G3. Drug management program to help members safely use their opioid medications
HealthPartners MSHO has a program that can help members safely use their prescription opioid medications and other medications that are frequently misused. This program is called a Drug Management Program (DMP).
If you use opioid medications that you get from several doctors or pharmacies or if you had a recent opioid overdose, we may talk to your doctors to make sure your use of opioid medications is appropriate and medically necessary. Working with your doctors, if we decide your use of prescription opioid or benzodiazepine medications is not safe, we may limit how you can get those medications. Limitations may include:
• Requiring you to get all prescriptions for those medications from a certain pharmacy and/or from a certain doctor
• Limiting the amount of those medications we will cover for you
If we think that one or more limitations should apply to you, we will send you a letter in advance. The
letter will explain the limitations we think should apply.
You will have a chance to tell us which doctors or pharmacies you prefer to use and any information you think is important for us to know. If we decide to limit your coverage for these medications after you have a chance to respond, we will send you another letter that confirms the limitations.
If you think we made a mistake, you disagree that you are at risk for prescription drug misuse, or you disagree with the limitation, you and your prescriber can file an appeal. If you file an appeal, we will review your case and give you our decision. If we continue to deny any part of your appeal related to limitations to your access to these medications, we will automatically send your case to an Independent Review Entity (IRE). (To learn how to file an appeal and to find out more about the IRE, see Chapter 9.)
The DMP may not apply to you if you:
• have certain medical conditions, such as cancer or sickle cell disease,
• are getting hospice, palliative, or end-of-life care, or
• live in a long-term care facility.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.

Chapter 6: What you pay for your Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid) prescription drugs
Introduction
This chapter tells what you pay for your outpatient prescription drugs. By “drugs,” we mean:
• Medicare Part D prescription drugs, and
• drugs and items covered under Medical Assistance (Medicaid), and
• drugs and items covered by the plan as additional benefits.
Because you are eligible for Medical Assistance (Medicaid), you are getting “Extra Help” from Medicare to help pay for your Medicare Part D prescription drugs.
Other key terms and their definitions appear in alphabetical order in the last chapter of the Member Handbook.
To learn more about prescription drugs, you can look in these places:
• The plan’s List of Covered Drugs.
o We call this the “Drug List.” It tells you:
− Which drugs the plan pays for
− Which cost-sharing tier level each drug is in
− Whether there are any limits on the drugs
o You can get a copy of the Drug List, by calling Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page. You can also find the Drug List on our website at healthpartners.com/msho. The Drug List on the website is always the most current.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
   Extra Help is a Medicare program that helps people with limited incomes and resources reduce Medicare Part D prescription drug costs, such as premiums, deductibles, and copays. Extra Help is also called the “Low-Income Subsidy,” or “LIS.”

 EOC-200.16-MSHO 131

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 6: What you pay for your Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid) prescription drugs
A. The Explanation of Benefits (EOB)
Our plan keeps track of your prescription drugs. We keep track of two types of costs:
• Your out-of-pocket costs. This is the amount of money you or others on your behalf pay for your prescriptions.
• Your total drug costs. This is the amount of money you or others on your behalf pay for your prescriptions, plus the amount the plan pays.
When you get prescription drugs through the plan, we send you a report called the Explanation of Benefits. We call it the EOB for short. The EOB has more information about the drugs you take. The EOB includes:
• Information for the month. The report tells what prescription drugs you got. It shows the total drug costs, what the plan paid, and what you and others paying for you paid.
• “Year-to-date” information. This is your total drug costs and the total payments made since January 1.
We offer coverage of drugs not covered under Medicare.
• Payments made for these drugs will not count towards your total out-of-pocket costs.
• To find out which drugs our plan covers, see the Drug List. In addition to the drugs covered under Medicare, some prescription and over-the-counter drugs are covered under Medical Assistance (Medicaid). These drugs are included in the Drug List.
B. How to keep track of your drug costs
To keep track of your drug costs and the payments you make, we use records we get from you and from your pharmacy. Here is how you can help us:
1. Use your Member ID Card.
Show your Member ID Card every time you get a prescription filled. This will help us know what prescriptions you fill and what you pay.
2. Make sure we have the information we need.
Give us copies of receipts for drugs that you have paid for. You can ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost of the drug.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
   EOC-200.16-MSHO 132

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 6: What you pay for your Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid) prescription drugs
Here are some times when you should give us copies of your receipts:
• When you buy a covered drug at a network pharmacy at a special price or using a discount card that is not part of our plan’s benefit
• When you pay a copay for drugs that you get under a drug maker’s patient assistance program
• When you buy covered drugs at an out-of-network pharmacy
• When you pay the full price for a covered drug
To learn how to ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost of the drug, see Chapter 7, section
B.
NOTE: If the drug is covered by Medical Assistance (Medicaid), we do not allow HealthPartners MSHO providers to bill you for these drugs. We pay our providers directly, and we protect you from any charges. If you paid for a drug that you think we should have covered, contact Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page.
3. Send us information about the payments others have made for you.
Payments made by certain other people and organizations also count toward your out-of-pocket costs. For example, payments made by a state pharmaceutical assistance program, an AIDS drug assistance program, the Indian Health Service, and most charities count toward your out-of-pocket costs.
This can help you qualify for catastrophic coverage. When you reach the Catastrophic Coverage Stage, HealthPartners MSHO pays all of the costs of your Medicare Part D drugs for the rest of the year. Medical Assistance (Medicaid)-covered drugs will not be included or tracked to move you to the next coverage stage.
4. Check the reports we send you.
When you get an Explanation of Benefits in the mail, please make sure it is complete and correct. If you think something is wrong or missing from the report, or if you have any questions, please call Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page. Be sure to keep these reports. They are an important record of your drug expenses.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 6: What you pay for your Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid) prescription drugs
C. Drug Payment Stages for Medicare Part D drugs
There are two payment stages for your Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage under HealthPartners MSHO. How much you pay depends on which stage you are in when you get a prescription filled or refilled. These are the two stages:
      Stage 1: Initial Coverage Stage
During this stage, the plan pays part of the costs of your drugs, and you pay your share. Your share is called the copay.
You begin in this stage when you fill your first prescription of the year.
D. Stage 1: The Initial Coverage Stage
Stage 2: Catastrophic Coverage State
During this stage, the plan pays all of the costs of your drugs through December 31, 2021.
You begin this stage when you have paid a certain amount of out-of-pocket costs.
     During the Initial Coverage Stage, the plan pays a share of the cost of your covered prescription drugs, and you pay your share. Your share is called the copay. The copay depends on what cost- sharing tier level the drug is in and where you get it.
D1. The plan’s cost-sharing tiers
Cost-sharing tier levels are groups of drugs with the same copay. To find the cost-sharing tier levels for your drugs, you can look in the Drug List.
• Tier 1 Generic drugs have the lowest copay. The copay is from $0 to $3.70, depending on your income and level of Medical Assistance (Medicaid) eligibility.
• Tier 1 Brand name drugs have a higher copay. The copay is from $0 to $9.20, depending on your income and level of Medical Assistance (Medicaid) eligibility.
• OTCs have a $0 copay.
 If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
EOC-200.16-MSHO 134

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 6: What you pay for your Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid) prescription drugs
D2. Your pharmacy choices
How much you pay for a drug depends on whether you get the drug from:
• a network pharmacy, or
• an out-of-network pharmacy.
In limited cases, we cover prescriptions filled at out-of-network pharmacies. See Chapter 5, section A8 to find out when we will do that.
To learn more about these pharmacy choices, see Chapter 5, section A1 in this handbook and the plan’s Provider and Pharmacy Directory.
D3. Getting a long-term supply of a drug
For some drugs, you can get a long-term supply (also called an “extended supply”) when you fill your prescription. A long-term supply is up to a 90-day supply. It costs you the same as a one-month supply.
For details on where and how to get a long-term supply of a drug, see Chapter 5, section A7 or the
Provider and Pharmacy Directory.
D4. What you pay
During the Initial Coverage Stage, you may pay a copay each time you fill a prescription. If your covered drug costs less than the copay, you will pay the lower price.
You can contact Member Services to find out how much your copay is for any covered drug.
 If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 6: What you pay for your Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid) prescription drugs
D5. End of the Initial Coverage Stage
The Initial Coverage Stage ends when your total out-of-pocket costs reach $6,550. At that point, the Catastrophic Coverage Stage begins. The plan covers all your drug costs from then until the end of the year.
Your Explanation of Benefits reports will help you keep track of how much you have paid for your drugs during the year. We will let you know if you reach the $6,550 limit. Many people do not reach it in a year.
E. Stage 2: The Catastrophic Coverage Stage
When you reach the out-of-pocket limit of $6,550 for your prescription drugs, the Catastrophic Coverage Stage begins. You will stay in the Catastrophic Coverage Stage until the end of the calendar year. During this stage, the plan will pay all of the costs for your Medicare drugs.
F. Your drug costs if your doctor prescribes less than a full month’s supply
Typically, you pay a copay to cover a full month’s supply of a covered drug. However, your doctor can prescribe less than a month’s supply of drugs.
• There may be times when you want to ask your doctor about prescribing less than a month’s supply of a drug (for example, when you are trying a drug for the first time that is known to have serious side effects).
• If your doctor agrees, you will not have to pay for the full month’s supply for certain drugs.
When you get less than a month’s supply of a drug, the amount you pay will be based on the number of days of the drug that you get. We will calculate the amount you pay per day for your drug (the “daily cost-sharing rate”) and multiply it by the number of days of the drug you get.
• Here’s an example: Let’s say the copay for your drug for a full month’s supply (a 30-day supply) is $1.30. This means that the amount you pay for your drug is a little more than $0.04 per day. If you get a 7 days’ supply of the drug, your payment will be a little more than $0.04 per day multiplied by 7 days, for a total payment of about $0.30.
• Daily cost-sharing allows you to make sure a drug works for you before you have to pay for an entire month’s supply.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 6: What you pay for your Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid) prescription drugs
• You can also ask your provider to prescribe less than a full month’s supply of a drug if this will help you:
o better plan when to refill your drugs,
o coordinate refills with other drugs you take, and/or o take fewer trips to the pharmacy.
G. Vaccinations
Our plan covers Medicare Part D vaccines. There are two parts to our coverage of Medicare Part D vaccinations:
1. The first part of coverage is for the cost of the vaccine itself. The vaccine is a prescription drug.
2. The second part of coverage is for the cost of giving you the vaccine. For example, sometimes
you may get the vaccine as a shot given to you by your doctor.
G1. What you need to know before you get a vaccination
We recommend that you call us first at Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page whenever you are planning to get a vaccination.
• We can tell you about how your vaccination is covered by our plan and explain your share of the cost.
• We can tell you how to keep your costs down by using network pharmacies and providers. Network pharmacies are pharmacies that have agreed to work with our plan. A network provider is a provider who works with the health plan. A network provider should work with HealthPartners MSHO to ensure that you do not have any upfront costs for a Part D vaccine.
G2. What you pay for a Medicare Part D vaccination
What you pay for a vaccination depends on the type of vaccine (what you are being vaccinated for).
• Some vaccines are considered health benefits rather than drugs. These vaccines are covered at no cost to you. To learn about coverage of these vaccines, see the Benefits Chart in Chapter 4, section D.
• Other vaccines are considered Medicare Part D drugs. You can find these vaccines listed in the plan’s Drug List. You may have to pay a copay for Medicare Part D vaccines.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 6: What you pay for your Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid) prescription drugs
Here are three common ways you might get a Medicare Part D vaccination.
1. You get the Medicare Part D vaccine at a network pharmacy and get your shot at the pharmacy.
• You will pay a copay for the vaccine.
2. You get the Medicare Part D vaccine at your doctor’s office and the doctor gives you the shot.
• You will pay a copay to the doctor for the vaccine.
• Our plan will pay for the cost of giving you the shot.
• The doctor’s office should call our plan in this situation so we can make sure they know you only have to pay a copay for the vaccine.
3. You get the Medicare Part D vaccine itself at a pharmacy and take it to your doctor’s office to get the shot.
• You will pay a copay for the vaccine.
• Our plan will pay for the cost of giving you the shot.
If you paid for a Medicare Part D drug, including a Part D vaccine, that you think we should have
covered, contact Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page.

EOC-200.16-MSHO 140

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 7: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have gotten for covered services or drugs
A. Asking us to pay for your services or drugs
You should not get a bill for in-network services or drugs. Our network providers must bill the plan for the services and drugs you already got. A network provider is a provider who works with the health plan.
We do not allow HealthPartners MSHO providers to bill you for these services or drugs. We pay our providers directly, and we protect you from any charges.
If you get a bill for the full cost of health care services or drugs, send the bill to us. You should not pay the bill yourself. To send us a bill, see Section B of this chapter.
• If the services or drugs are covered, we will pay the provider directly.
• If the services or drugs are not covered, we will tell you.
• Remember, if you get a bill from a provider, you should not pay the bill yourself.
Contact Member Services if you have any questions. If you do not know what you should have paid or if you get a bill and you do not know what to do about it, we can help. You can also call if you want to tell us information about a request for payment you already sent to us.
Here are examples of times when you may need to ask our plan to pay a bill you got or to pay you back:
1. When you get emergency or urgently needed care from an out-of-network provider
You should ask the provider to bill the plan.
• You may get a bill from the provider asking for payment that you think you do not owe. Send us the bill.
• If the provider should be paid, we will pay the provider directly.
2. When a network provider sends you a bill
Network providers must always bill the plan. Show your HealthPartners MSHO Member ID Card when you get any services or prescriptions. Improper/inappropriate billing occurs when a provider (such as a doctor or hospital) bills you more than your share of the cost for services. Call Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page if you get any bills.
• As a member of HealthPartners MSHO, you only have to pay the copay when you get services covered by our plan. We do not allow providers to bill you more than this amount. This is true even if we pay the provider less than the provider charged for a service. If we decide not to pay for some charges, you still do not have to pay them.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
  EOC-200.16-MSHO 141

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 7: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have gotten for covered services or drugs
• Whenever you get a bill from a network provider that you think is more than you should pay, send us the bill. We will contact the provider directly and take care of the problem.
3. When you use an out-of-network pharmacy to get a prescription filled
If you go to an out-of-network pharmacy, you will have to pay the full cost of your Part D prescription.
• In only a few cases, we will cover Part D prescriptions filled at out-of-network pharmacies. Send us a copy of your receipt when you ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost.
• Please see Chapter 5, section A8 to learn more about out-of-network pharmacies.
4. When you pay the full cost for a Part D prescription because you do not have your
Member ID Card with you
If you do not have your Member ID Card with you, you can ask the pharmacy to call the plan or to look up your plan enrollment information.
• If the pharmacy cannot get the information they need right away, you may have to pay the full cost of the Part D prescription yourself.
• Send us a copy of your receipt when you ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost.
5. When you pay the full cost for a Part D prescription drug that is not covered
You may pay the full cost of the Part D prescription because the drug is not covered.
• The drug may not be on the plan’s List of Covered Drugs (Drug List), or it could have a requirement or restriction that you did not know about or do not think should apply to you. If you decide to get the drug, you may need to pay the full cost for it.
o If you do not pay for the drug but think it should be covered, you can ask for a coverage decision (see Chapter 9, section F1).
o If you and your doctor or other prescriber think you need the drug right away, you can ask for a fast coverage decision (see Chapter 9, section F4).
• Send us a copy of your receipt when you ask us to pay you back. In some situations, we may need to get more information from your doctor or other prescriber in order to pay you back for our share of the cost of the drug.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711.

This is called making a “coverage decision.” If we decide it should be covered, we will pay for our share of the cost of the drug. If we deny your request for payment, you can appeal our decision.
To learn how to make an appeal, see Chapter 9, section F5.
B. Sending a request for payment

When we get your request for payment, we will make a coverage decision. This means that we will decide whether your health care or drug is covered by the plan.

You have the right to get full information from your doctors and other health care providers when you get services. Your providers must explain your condition and your treatment choices in a way that you can understand. You have the right to:
• Know your choices. You have the right to be told about all the kinds of treatment.
• Know the risks. You have the right to be told about any risks involved. You must be told in advance if any service or treatment is part of a research experiment. You have the right to refuse experimental treatments.
• Get a second opinion. You have the right to see another doctor before deciding on treatment.
• Say “no.” You have the right to refuse any treatment. This includes the right to leave a hospital or other medical facility, even if your doctor advises you not to. You also have the right to stop taking a drug. If you refuse treatment or stop taking a drug, you will not be dropped from the plan. However, if you refuse treatment or stop taking a drug, you accept full responsibility for what happens to you.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 8: Your rights and responsibilities
• Ask us to explain why a provider denied care. You have the right to get an explanation from us if a provider has denied care that you believe you should get.
• Ask us to cover a service or drug that was denied or is usually not covered. This is called a coverage decision. Chapter 9, section D tells how to ask the plan for a coverage decision.
G2. Your right to say what you want to happen if you are unable to make health care decisions for yourself
Sometimes people are unable to make health care decisions for themselves. Before that happens to you, you can:
• Fill out a written form to give someone the right to make health care decisions for you.
• Give your doctors written instructions about how you want them to handle your health
care if you become unable to make decisions for yourself.
The legal document that you can use to give your directions is called an advance directive. There are different types of advance directives and different names for them. Examples are a living will and a power of attorney for health care or a health care directive.
• You do not have to use an advance directive, but you can if you want to. Here is what to do:
• Get the form. You can get a form from your doctor, a lawyer, a legal services agency, or a social worker. The Senior LinkAge Line® is an organization that gives people information about Medicare or Medical Assistance (Medicaid), including resources for getting a form at www.minnesotahelp.info. You can also contact Member Services to ask for the form.
• Fill it out and sign the form. The form is a legal document. You should consider having a lawyer help you prepare it.
• Give copies to people who need to know about it. You should give a copy of the form to your doctor. You should also give a copy to the person you name as the one to make decisions for you. You may also want to give copies to close friends or family members. Be sure to keep a copy at home.
• If you are going to be hospitalized and you have signed an advance directive, take a copy of it to the hospital.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
  EOC-200.16-MSHO 151

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 8: Your rights and responsibilities
The hospital will ask you whether you have signed an advance directive form and whether you have it with you.
If you have not signed an advance directive form, the hospital has forms available and will ask if you want to sign one.
Remember, it is your choice to fill out an advance directive or not. G3. What to do if your instructions are not followed
If you have signed an advance directive, and you believe that a doctor or hospital did not follow the instructions in it, you may file a complaint with the Office of Health Facility Complaints at the Minnesota Department of Health at 651-201-4201, or toll-free at 1-800-369-7994.
H. Your right to make complaints and to ask us to reconsider decisions we have made
Chapter 9, section J tells what you can do if you have any problems or concerns about your covered services or care. For example, you could ask us to make a coverage decision, make an appeal to us to change a coverage decision, or make a complaint.
You have the right to get information about appeals and complaints that other members have filed against our plan. To get this information, call Member Services.
H1. What to do if you believe you are being treated unfairly or you would like more information about your rights

 I. Your responsibilities as a member of the plan
As a member of the plan, you have a responsibility to do the things that are listed below. If you have any questions, you can call Member Services at the number at the bottom of the page.
• Read this Member Handbook to learn what is covered and what rules you need to follow to get covered services and drugs. For details about your:
o Covered services, see Chapters 3 and 4. Those chapters tell you what is covered, what is not covered, what rules you need to follow, and what you pay.
o Covered drugs, see Chapters 5 and 6.
• Tell us about any other health or prescription drug coverage you have. We are required to make sure you are using all of your coverage options when you get health care. Please call Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page if you have other coverage.
• Tell your doctor and other health care providers that you are enrolled in our plan. Show your HealthPartners MSHO Member ID Card whenever you get services or drugs.
• Help your doctors and other health care providers give you the best care.
o Give them the information they need about you and your health. Learn as much as you can about your health problems. Follow the treatment plans and instructions that you and your providers agree on.
o Establish a relationship with a plan network primary care doctor before you become ill. This helps you and your primary care doctor understand your total health condition.
o Make sure your doctors and other providers know about all of the drugs you are taking. This includes prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and supplements.
o Practice preventive health care. Have tests, exams, and shots recommended for you based on your age and gender.
o If you have any questions, be sure to ask. Your doctors and other providers must explain things in a way you can understand. If you ask a question and you do not understand the answer, ask again.
• Be considerate. We expect all our members to respect the rights of other patients. We also expect you to act with respect in your doctor’s office, hospitals, and other providers’ offices.

• Pay what you owe. As a plan member, you are responsible for these payments:
o Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B premiums. For most HealthPartners MSHO members, Medical Assistance (Medicaid) pays for your Part A premium and for your Part B premium.
o For some of your drugs covered by the plan, you must pay your share of the cost when you get the drug. This will be a copay (a fixed amount). Chapter 6, section D tells what you must pay for your drugs.
o If you get any services or drugs that are not covered by our plan, you must pay the full cost. (Note: If you disagree with our decision to not cover a service or drug, you can make an appeal. Please see Chapter 9 to learn how to make an appeal.)
• Tell us if you move. If you are going to move, it is important to tell us right away. Call Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page or notify your county social services offices.
o If you move outside of our service area, you cannot stay in this plan. Only people who live in our service area can get HealthPartners MSHO. Chapter 1, section D tells about our service area.
o We can help you figure out whether you are moving outside our service area. We can let you know if we have a plan in your new area.
o Also, be sure to let Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid) know your new address when you move. See Chapter 2 for phone numbers for Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid).
o If you move within our service area, we still need to know. We need to keep your membership record up to date and know how to contact you.

 EOC-200.16-MSHO 160

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
A. What to do if you have a problem
This chapter tells you what to do if you have a problem with your plan or with your covered services or drugs or payment. Medicare and Medical Assistance (Medicaid) approved these processes. Each process has a set of rules, procedures, and deadlines that must be followed by us and by you.
A1. About the legal terms
There are difficult legal terms for some of the rules and deadlines in this chapter. Many of these terms can be hard to understand, so we have used simpler words in place of certain legal terms. We use abbreviations as little as possible.
For example, we will say:
• “Making a complaint” rather than “filing a grievance”
• “Coverage decision” rather than “organization determination,” “benefit determination,” “at risk- determination,” or “coverage determination”
• “Fast coverage decision” rather than “expedited determination”
Knowing the proper legal terms may help you communicate more clearly, so we provide those too.
B. Where to call for help
B1. Where to get more information and help
Sometimes it can be confusing to start or follow the process for dealing with a problem. This can be especially true if you do not feel well or have limited energy. Other times, you may not have the knowledge you need to take the next step.
You can get help from the Ombudsman for Public Managed Health Care Programs
If you need help, you can always call the Ombudsman for Public Managed Health Care Programs. The Ombudsman for Public Managed Health Care Programs can answer your questions and help you understand what to do to handle your problem. See Chapter 2, section I for more information on ombudsman programs.
The Ombudsman for Public Managed Health Care Programs is not connected with us or with any insurance company or health plan. They can help you understand which process to use. The phone number for the Ombudsman for Public Managed Health Care Programs is 651-431-2660 or 1-800- 657-3729 or TTY MN Relay 711. The services are free.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711.

You can get help from the State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP)
You can also call your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP). SHIP counselors can answer your questions and help you understand what to do to handle your problem. The SHIP is not connected with us or with any insurance company or health plan. The SHIP has trained counselors in every state, and services are free. In Minnesota the SHIP is called the Senior LinkAge Line®. The phone number for the Senior LinkAge Line® is 1-800-333-2433 or TTY MN Relay 711. These calls are free.
Getting help from Medicare

• Visit the Medicare website at www.medicare.gov. C. Problems with your benefits
C1. Using the process for coverage decisions and appeals or for making a complaint
If you have a problem or concern, you only need to read the parts of this chapter that apply to your situation. The chart below will help you find the right section of this chapter for problems or complaints.
Is your problem or concern about your benefits or coverage?
(This includes problems about whether particular medical care or prescription drugs are covered or not, the way in which they are covered, and problems related to payment for medical care or prescription drugs.)
    Yes.
My problem is about benefits or coverage.
Go to Section D: “Coverage decisions and appeals” on page 163.
No.
My problem is not about benefits or coverage.
Skip ahead to Section J: “How to make a complaint” on page 203.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
D. Coverage decisions and appeals
D1. Overview of coverage decisions and appeals
The process for asking for coverage decisions and making appeals deals with problems related to your benefits and coverage. It also includes problems with payment.
What is a coverage decision?
A coverage decision is an initial decision we make about your benefits and coverage or about the amount we will pay for your medical services, items, or drugs. We are making a coverage decision whenever we decide what is covered for you and how much we pay.
If you or your doctor are not sure if a service, item, or drug is covered by Medicare or Medical Assistance (Medicaid), either of you can ask for a coverage decision before the doctor gives the service, item, or drug.
What is an appeal?
An appeal is a formal way of asking us to review our decision and change it if you think we made a mistake. For example, we might decide that a service, item, or drug that you want is not covered or is no longer covered by Medicare or Medical Assistance (Medicaid). If you or your doctor disagree with our decision, you can appeal.
D2. Getting help with coverage decisions and appeals
Who can I call for help asking for coverage decisions or making an appeal? You can ask any of these people for help:
• Call Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page.
• Call the Ombudsman for Public Managed Health Care Programs for free help. The Ombudsman for Public Managed Health Care Programs helps people enrolled in Medical Assistance (Medicaid) with service or billing problems. The phone number is 651-431-2660 or 1-800-657-3729 or TTY MN Relay 711.
• Call the State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) for free help. The SHIP is an independent organization. It is not connected with this plan. In Minnesota the SHIP is called the Senior LinkAge Line®. The phone number is 1-800-333-2433 or TTY MN Relay 711. These calls are free.
• Talk to your doctor or other health care provider. Your doctor or other health care provider can ask for a coverage decision or appeal on your behalf.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711.

  EOC-200.16-MSHO 163

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
• Talk to a friend or family member and ask them to act for you. You can name another person to act for you as your “representative” to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal.
o If you want a friend, relative, or other person to be your representative, call Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page and ask for the “Appointment of Representative” form.
o You can also get the form by visiting www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS- Forms/downloads/cms1696.pdf or on our website at healthpartners.com/msho. The form gives the person permission to act for you. You must give us a copy of the signed form.
• You also have the right to ask a lawyer to act for you. You may call your own lawyer or get the name of a lawyer from the local bar association or other referral service. Some legal groups will give you free legal services if you qualify. If you want a lawyer to represent you, you will need to fill out the Appointment of Representative form.
o However, you do not have to have a lawyer to ask for any kind of coverage decision or to make an appeal.
D3. Using the section of this chapter that will help you
There are four different types of situations that involve coverage decisions and appeals. Each situation has different rules and deadlines. We separate this chapter into different sections to help you find the rules you need to follow. You only need to read the section that applies to your problem:
• Section E on page 166 gives you information if you have problems about services, items, or drugs (but not Part D drugs). For example, use this section if:
o You are not getting medical care you want, and you believe our plan covers this care. o We did not approve services, items, or drugs (not covered by Part D) that your doctor
wants to give you, and you believe this care should be covered.
NOTE: Only use Section E if these are drugs not covered by Part D. Medical Assistance (Medicaid) covered drugs such as over the counter drugs are not covered by Part D. See Section F on page 179 for Part D drug appeals.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
   EOC-200.16-MSHO 164

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
o You got medical care or services you think should be covered, but we are not paying for this care.
o You got and paid for medical services or items you thought were covered, and you want to ask us to pay the provider so you can get a refund.
– NOTE: We do not allow our network providers to bill you for covered services and items. We pay our providers directly, and we protect you from any charges. If you paid for a service or item that you think we should have covered, contact Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page.
o You are being told that coverage for care you have been getting will be reduced or stopped, and you disagree with our decision.
– NOTE: If the coverage that will be stopped is for hospital care, home health care, skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services, you need to read Sections G and H of this chapter because special rules apply to these types of care. See Sections G and H on pages 190 and 196.
• Section F on page 179 gives you information about Part D drugs. For example, use this section if:
o You want to ask us to make an exception to cover a Part D drug that is not on our Drug List.
o You want to ask us to waive limits on the amount of the drug you can get.
o You want to ask us to cover a drug that requires prior approval.
o We did not approve your request or exception, and you or your doctor or other prescriber thinks we should have.
o You want to ask us to pay for a prescription drug you already bought. (This is asking for a coverage decision about payment.)
• Section G on page 190 gives you information on how to ask us to cover a longer inpatient hospital stay if you think the doctor is discharging you too soon. Use this section if:
o You are in the hospital and think the doctor asked you to leave the hospital too soon.
• Section H on page 196 gives you information if you think your home health care, skilled nursing facility care, and Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services are ending too soon.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711.

How long does it take to get a coverage decision?
It usually takes up to 14 calendar days after you asked unless your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug, we will give you a decision no more than 72 hours after we receive your request. If we don’t give you our decision within 14 calendar days (or 72 hours for a Medicare Part B prescription drug), you can appeal.
Sometimes we need more time, and we will send you a letter telling you that we need to take up to 14 more calendar days. The letter will explain why more time is needed. We can’t take extra time to give you a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug.
Can I get a coverage decision faster?
Yes. If you need a response faster because of your health, ask us to make a “fast coverage decision.” If we approve the request, we will notify you of our decision within 72 hours (or within 24 hours for a Medicare Part B prescription drug).
However, sometimes we need more time, and we will send you a letter telling you that we need to take up to 14 more calendar days. The letter will explain why more time is needed. We can’t take extra time to give you a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug.
The legal term for “fast coverage decision” is “expedited determination.”

    EOC-200.16-MSHO 167

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
Asking for a fast coverage decision:
• If you request a fast coverage decision, start by calling or faxing our plan to ask us to cover the care you want.
• You can call us at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285, TTY: 711 or fax us at 952-853-8742. For details on how to contact us, go to Chapter 2, section A.
• You can also have your doctor or your representative call us.
Here are the rules for asking for a fast coverage decision:
You must meet the following two requirements to get a fast coverage decision:
1. You can get a fast coverage decision only if you are asking for coverage for medical care or an item you have not yet received. (You cannot ask for a fast coverage decision if your request is about payment for medical care or an item you already got.)
2. You can get a fast coverage decision only if the standard 14 calendar day deadline (or the 72 hour deadline for Medicare Part B prescription drugs) could cause serious harm to your health or hurt your ability to function.
• If your doctor says that you need a fast coverage decision for one of the reasons above, we will automatically give you one.
• If you ask for a fast coverage decision without your doctor’s support, we will decide if you get a fast coverage decision.
o If we decide that your health does not meet the requirements for a fast coverage decision, we will send you a letter. We will also use the standard 14 calendar day deadline (or the 72 hour deadline for Medicare Part B prescription drugs) instead.
o This letter will tell you that if your doctor asks for the fast coverage decision, we will automatically give a fast coverage decision.
o The letter will also tell how you can file a “fast complaint” about our decision to give you a standard coverage decision instead of a fast coverage decision. For more information about the process for making complaints, including fast complaints, see Section J on page 203.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
If the coverage decision is No, how will I find out?
If the answer is No, we will send you a letter telling you our reasons for saying No.
• If we say No, you have the right to ask us to change this decision by making an appeal. Making an appeal means asking us to review our decision to deny coverage.
• If you decide to make an appeal, it means you are going on to Level 1 of the appeals process (read the next section for more information).
E3. Level 1 Appeal for services, items, and drugs (not Part D drugs)
What is an Appeal?
An appeal is a formal way of asking us to review our decision and change it if you think we made a mistake. If you or your doctor or other provider disagree with our decision, you can appeal. You must start your appeal at Level 1.
If you need help during the appeals process, you can call the Ombudsman for Public Managed Health Care Programs at 651-431-2660 or 1-800-657-3729 or TTY MN Relay 711. The Ombudsman for Public Managed Health Care Programs is not connected with us or with any insurance company or health plan.
What is a Level 1 Appeal?
A Level 1 Appeal is the first appeal to our plan. We will review your coverage decision to see if it is correct. The reviewer will be someone who did not make the original coverage decision. When we complete the review, we will give you our decision in writing.
If we tell you after our review that the service or item is not covered, your case can go to a Level 2 Appeal.
  At a glance: How to make a Level 1 Appeal
You, your doctor, or your representative may put your request in writing and mail or fax it to us. You may also ask for an appeal by calling us.
• Ask within 60 calendar days of the decision you are appealing. If you miss the deadline for a good reason, you may still appeal.
• If you appeal because we told you that a service you currently get will be changed or stopped, you have 10 days to appeal if you want to keep getting that service while your appeal is processing.
• Keep reading this section to learn about what deadline applies to your appeal.

How much time do I have to make an appeal?
You must ask for an appeal within 60 calendar days from the date on the letter we sent to tell you
our decision.
If you miss this deadline and have a good reason for missing it, we may give you more time to make your appeal. Examples of a good reason are: you had a serious illness, or we gave you the wrong information about the deadline for requesting an appeal. You should explain the reason your appeal is late when you make your appeal.
NOTE: If you appeal because we told you that a service you currently get will be changed or stopped, you have 10 days to appeal if you want to keep getting that service while your appeal is processing. Read “Will my benefits continue during Level 1 appeals” on page 173 for more information.
Can I get a copy of my case file?
Yes. Ask us for a free copy by calling Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page. Can my doctor give you more information about my appeal?
Yes, you and your doctor may give us more information to support your appeal.
How will we make the appeal decision?
We take a careful look at all of the information about your request for coverage of medical care. Then, we check to see if we were following all the rules when we said No to your request. The reviewer will be someone who did not make the original decision.
If we need more information, we may ask you or your doctor for it.
When will I hear about a “standard” appeal decision?
We must give you our answer within 30 calendar days after we get your appeal (or within 7 calendar days after we get your appeal for a Medicare Part B prescription drug). We will give you our decision sooner if your health condition requires us to.
• However, if you ask for more time or if we need to gather more information, we can take up to 14 more calendar days, for a total of 44 calendar days.

A State Appeal (Medicaid Fair Hearing with the state) is a hearing at the State to review a decision made by the plan. You must request a hearing in writing. You may ask for a hearing if you disagree with:
• The delivery of health services;
• Enrollment in the plan;
• Denial in full or part of a claim or service;
• Our failure to act within required timelines for prior authorizations and appeals; or
• Any other action.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
You must ask for a State Appeal (Medicaid Fair Hearing with the state) within 120 days of the date of the plan’s appeal decision.
Mail, fax, or submit your written request to:
Minnesota Department of Human Services Appeals Office
P.O. Box 64941

Fax: 651- 431-7523
Online Appeal Form:
edocs.dhs.state.mn.us/lfserver/Public/DHS-0033-ENG
A Human Services Judge from the State Appeals Office will hold the hearing. Your meeting will be by telephone unless you ask for a face-to-face meeting. During your hearing, tell the Judge why you disagree with the decision made by the plan. You can ask a friend, relative, advocate, provider, or lawyer to help you.
The process can take between 30 and 90 days. If your hearing is about an urgently needed service and you need an answer faster, tell the State Appeals Office when you file your hearing request. If your hearing is about a medical necessity denial, you may ask for an expert medical opinion from an outside reviewer. There is no cost to you.
If you need help at any point in the process, call the Ombudsman for Public Managed Health Care Programs at 651-431-2660 or 1-800-657-3729 or TTY MN Relay 711.
My problem is about a Medicare service or item. What will happen at the Level 2 Appeal?
An Independent Review Entity (IRE) will carefully review the Level 1 decision and decide whether it should be changed.
• You do not need to request the Level 2 Appeal. We will automatically send any denials (in whole or in part) to the IRE. You will be notified when this happens.
• The IRE is hired by Medicare and is not connected with this plan.
• You may ask for a copy of your file by calling Member Services at the number at the bottom
of this page.

  EOC-200.16-MSHO 175

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
The IRE must give you an answer to your Level 2 Appeal within 30 calendar days of when it gets your appeal (or within 7 calendar days of when it gets your appeal for a Medicare Part B prescription drug). This rule applies if you sent your appeal before getting medical services or items.
• However, if the IRE needs to gather more information that may benefit you, it can take up to 14 more calendar days. If the IRE needs extra days to make a decision, it will tell you by letter. The IRE can’t take extra time to make a decision if your appeal is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug.
If you had a “fast appeal” at Level 1, you will automatically have a fast appeal at Level 2. The IRE must give you an answer within 72 hours of when it gets your appeal.
• However, if the IRE needs to gather more information that may benefit you, it can take up to 14 more calendar days. If the IRE needs extra days to make a decision, it will tell you by letter. The IRE can’t take extra time to make a decision if your appeal is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug.
Will my benefits continue during Level 2 appeals?
If the disputed service or item is covered by Medicare only, we will not continue to cover that service
or item during your appeal. This includes drugs covered by Part D.
If the disputed service or item could be covered by Medical Assistance (Medicaid), we will continue to cover that service or item during your appeal if the following conditions are met:
• We previously approved coverage for the service or item but then decided to reduce or stop the coverage before the authorization expired. We will send you a notice before taking the action to reduce or stop your coverage.
• You file a request for a State Appeal (Medicaid Fair Hearing with the state) within 10 calendar days of the date on our appeal resolution letter or before the intended effective date of the action, whichever is later.
• You ask to continue getting the service.
If you meet all of these conditions, we will continue to cover the service or item until your State Appeal (Medicaid Fair Hearing with the state) is resolved. If you lose the appeal you may be billed for the service or item, but only if state policy allows this.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
How will I find out about the decision?
If you had a State Appeal (Medicaid Fair Hearing with the state), the State Appeals Office will send you a written notice explaining its decision.
• If the State Appeals Office says Yes to part or all of what you asked for, we must promptly authorize the coverage.
• If the State Appeals Office says No to part or all of what you asked for, it means they agree with or affirm the plan’s decision. This is called “upholding the decision.”
If your Level 2 Appeal went to the Independent Review Entity (IRE), it will send you a letter explaining its decision.
• If the IRE says Yes to part or all of what you asked for in your standard appeal, we must authorize the medical care coverage within 72 hours or give you the service or item within 14 calendar days from the date we get the IRE’s decision. If you had a fast appeal, we must authorize the medical care coverage or give you the service or item within 72 hours from the date we get the IRE’s decision.
• If the IRE says Yes to part or all of what you asked for in your standard appeal for a Medicare Part B prescription drug, we must authorize or provide the Medicare Part B prescription drug within 72 hours after we get the IRE’s decision. If you had a fast appeal, we must authorize or provide the Medicare Part B prescription drug within 24 hours from the date we get the IRE’s decision.
• If the IRE says No to part or all of what you asked for, it means they agree with the Level 1 decision. This is called “upholding the decision.” It is also called “turning down your appeal.”
If the decision is No for all or part of what I asked for, can I make another appeal?
If you had a State Appeal (Medicaid Fair Hearing with the state) and you disagree with the ruling, you may appeal to the District Court in your county.
If your Level 2 Appeal went to the Independent Review Entity (IRE), you can appeal again only if the dollar value of the service or item you want meets a certain minimum amount. The letter you get from the IRE will explain additional appeal rights you may have.
See Section I on page 202 for more information on additional levels of appeal.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
E5. Payment problems
We do not allow our network providers to bill you for covered services and items. This is true even if we pay the provider less than the provider charges for a covered service or item. You are never required to pay the balance of any bill. The only amount you should be asked to pay is the copay for drug categories that require a copay.
If you get a bill that is more than your copay for covered services or items, send the bill to us. You should not pay the bill yourself. We will contact the provider directly and take care of the problem.
For more information, start by reading Chapter 7: “Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have gotten for covered services or drugs.” Chapter 7 describes the situations in which you may need to ask us to pay a bill you got from a provider. It also tells how to send us the paperwork that asks us for payment.
Can I ask you to pay for a service or item I paid for?
Remember, if you get a bill that is more than your copay for covered services or items, you should not pay the bill yourself. But if you do pay the bill, you can get a refund from that provider if you followed the rules for getting services or items.
If you paid a provider for a service or item and you think we should pay the provider instead, you are asking for a coverage decision. We will see if the service or item you paid for is a covered service or item, and we will check to see if you followed all the rules for using your coverage.
• If the service or item you paid for is covered and you followed all the rules, we will send the provider the payment for our share of the cost of the service or item within 60 calendar days after we get your request. We will also work with the provider to make sure that your payment is refunded
• If you haven’t paid for the service or item yet, we will send the payment directly to the provider. When we send the payment, it’s the same as saying Yes to your request for a coverage decision.
• If the service or item is not covered, or you did not follow all the rules, we will send you a letter telling you we will not pay for the service or item, and explaining why.
 If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
EOC-200.16-MSHO 178

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
What if we say we will not pay?
If you do not agree with our decision, you can make an appeal. Follow the appeals process
described in Section E3 on page 169. When you follow these instructions, please note:
• If you make an appeal for a service or item you already got and paid for yourself, we must give you our answer within 60 calendar days after we get your appeal.
• If you are asking us to pay for a service or item you already got and paid for yourself, you cannot ask for a fast appeal.
If we answer No to your appeal and the service or item is usually covered by Medicare, we will automatically send your case to the Independent Review Entity (IRE). We will notify you by letter if this happens.
• If the IRE reverses our decision and says we should pay for the service or item, we must send the payment to the provider within 30 calendar days. If the answer to your appeal is Yes at any stage of the appeals process after Level 2, we must send the payment you asked for to the provider within 60 calendar days.
• If the IRE says No to your appeal, it means they agree with our decision not to approve your request. (This is called “upholding the decision.” It is also called “turning down your appeal.”) The letter you get will explain additional appeal rights you may have. You can appeal again only if the dollar value of the service or item you want meets a certain minimum amount. See Section I on page 202 for more information on additional levels of appeal.
If we answer No to your appeal and the service or item is usually covered by Medical Assistance (Medicaid), you can ask for a State Appeal (Medicaid Fair Hearing with the state) (see Section E4 on page 174).
F. Part D drugs
F1. What to do if you have problems getting a Part D drug or you want us to pay you back for a Part D drug
Your benefits as a member of our plan include coverage for many prescription drugs. Most of these drugs are “Part D drugs.” There are a few drugs that Medicare Part D does not cover but that Medical Assistance (Medicaid) may cover, such as over-the-counter drugs. This section only applies to Part D drug appeals.
NOTE: For drugs covered only by Medical Assistance (Medicaid), follow the process in Section E on page 166.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
Can I ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal about Part D prescription drugs? Yes. Here are examples of coverage decisions you can ask us to make about your Part D drugs:
• You ask us to make an exception such as:
o Asking us to cover a Part D drug that is not on the plan’s Drug List
o Asking us to waive a restriction on the plan’s coverage for a drug (such as limits on the amount of the drug you can get)
• You ask us if a drug is covered for you (for example, when your drug is on the plan’s Drug List but we require you to get approval from us before we will cover it for you).
NOTE: If your pharmacy tells you that your prescription cannot be filled, you will get a notice explaining how to contact us to ask for a coverage decision.
• You ask us to pay for a prescription drug you already bought. This is asking for a coverage decision about payment.
The legal term for a coverage decision about your Part D drugs is “coverage determination.”
If you disagree with a coverage decision we have made, you can appeal our decision. This section
tells you how to ask for coverage decisions and how to request an appeal.
    If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
Use the chart below to help you decide which section has information for your situation:
Which of these situations are you in?
    Do you need a drug that isn’t on our Drug List or need us to waive a rule or restriction on a drug we cover?
You can ask us to make an exception. (This is a type of coverage decision.)
Start with Section F2 on page 181. Also see Sections F3 and F4 on page 182 and 183.
Do you want us to cover a drug on our Drug List and you believe you meet any plan rules or restrictions (such as getting approval in advance) for the drug you need?
You can ask us for a coverage decision.
Skip ahead to Section F4 on page 181.
Do you want to ask us to pay you back for a drug you already got and paid for?
You can ask us to pay you back. (This is a type of coverage decision.)
Skip ahead to Section F4 on page 181.
Have we already told you that we will not cover or pay for a drug in the way that you want it to be covered or paid for?
You can make a Level 1 appeal. (This means you are asking us to reconsider.)
Skip ahead to Section F5 on page 186.
         F2. What an exception is
An exception is permission to get coverage for a drug that is not normally on our List of Covered Drugs (Drug List) or to use the drug without certain rules and limitations. If a drug is not on our Drug List or is not covered in the way you would like, you can ask us to make an “exception.”
When you ask for an exception, your doctor or other prescriber will need to explain the medical reasons why you need the exception.
Here are examples of exceptions that you or your doctor or another prescriber can ask us to make: 1. Covering a Part D drug that is not on our Drug List.
• If we agree to make an exception and cover a drug that is not on the Drug List, you will need to pay the cost-sharing amount that applies to all of our drugs.
• You cannot ask for an exception to the copay or coinsurance amount we require you to pay for the drug.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
 EOC-200.16-MSHO 181

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
2. Removing a restriction on our coverage. There are extra rules or restrictions that apply to certain drugs on our Drug List (for more information, go to Chapter 5, section C).
• The extra rules and restrictions on coverage for certain drugs include:
o Being required to use the generic version of a drug instead of the brand name drug.
o Getting plan approval before we will agree to cover the drug for you. (This is sometimes called “prior authorization.”)
o Being required to try a different drug first before we will agree to cover the drug you are asking for. (This is sometimes called “step therapy.”)
o Quantity limits. For some drugs, we limit the amount of the drug you can have.
• If we agree to make an exception and waive a restriction for you, you can still ask for an
exception to the copay amount we require you to pay for the drug.
F3. Important things to know about asking for exceptions
Your doctor or other prescriber must tell us the medical reasons
Your doctor or other prescriber must give us a statement explaining the medical reasons for requesting an exception. Our decision about the exception will be faster if you include this information from your doctor or other prescriber when you ask for the exception.
Typically, our Drug List includes more than one drug for treating a particular condition. These are called “alternative” drugs. If an alternative drug would be just as effective as the drug you are asking for and would not cause more side effects or other health problems, we will generally not approve your request for an exception.
We will say Yes or No to your request for an exception
• If we say Yes to your request for an exception, the exception usually lasts until the end of the calendar year. This is true as long as your doctor continues to prescribe the drug for you and that drug continues to be safe and effective for treating your condition.
• If we say No to your request for an exception, you can ask for a review of our decision by making an appeal. Section F5 on page 186 tells how to make an appeal if we say No.
The next section tells you how to ask for a coverage decision, including an exception.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
  The legal term for asking for removal of a restriction on coverage for a drug is sometimes called asking for a “formulary exception.”

• You do not need to give your doctor or other prescriber written permission to ask us for a coverage decision on your behalf.
• If you want to ask us to pay you back for a drug, read Chapter 7 of this handbook. Chapter 7 describes times when you may need to ask for reimbursement. It also tells how to send us the paperwork that asks us to pay you back for our share of the cost of a drug you have paid for.
• If you are asking for an exception, provide the “supporting statement.” Your doctor or other prescriber must give us the medical reasons for the drug exception. We call this the “supporting statement.”
• Your doctor or other prescriber can fax or mail the statement to us. Or your doctor or other prescriber can tell us on the phone, and then fax or mail a statement.
  At a glance: How to ask for a coverage decision about a drug or payment
Call, write, or fax us to ask, or ask your representative or doctor or other prescriber to ask. We will give you an answer on a standard coverage decision within 72 hours. We will give you an answer on reimbursing you for a Part D drug you already paid for within 14 calendar days.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
If your health requires it, ask us to give you a “fast coverage decision”
We will use the “standard deadlines” unless we have agreed to use the “fast deadlines.”
• A standard coverage decision means we will give you an answer within 72 hours after we get your doctor’s statement.
• A fast coverage decision means we will give you an answer within 24 hours after we get your doctor’s statement.
The legal term for “fast coverage decision” is “expedited coverage determination.”
You can get a fast coverage decision only if you are asking for a drug you have not yet received. (You cannot get a fast coverage decision if you are asking us to pay you back for a drug you already bought.)
You can get a fast coverage decision only if using the standard deadlines could cause serious harm to your health or hurt your ability to function.
If your doctor or other prescriber tells us that your health requires a “fast coverage decision,” we will automatically agree to give you a fast coverage decision, and the letter will tell you that.
• If you ask for a fast coverage decision on your own (without your doctor’s or other prescriber’s support), we will decide whether you get a fast coverage decision.
• If we decide that your medical condition does not meet the requirements for a fast coverage decision, we will use the standard deadlines instead.
o We will send you a letter telling you that. The letter will tell you how to make a complaint about our decision to give you a standard decision.
o You can file a “fast complaint” and get a response to your complaint within 24 hours. For more information about the process for making complaints, including fast complaints, see Section J on page 203.
Deadlines for a “fast coverage decision”
• If we are using the fast deadlines, we must give you our answer within 24 hours. This means within 24 hours after we get your request. Or, if you are asking for an exception, 24 hours after we get your doctor’s or prescriber’s statement supporting your request. We will give you our answer sooner if your health requires it.
• If we do not meet this deadline, we will send your request to Level 2 of the appeals process. At Level 2, an Independent Review Entity will review your request.

  EOC-200.16-MSHO 186

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
If your health requires it, ask for a “fast appeal”
• If you are appealing a decision our plan made about a drug you have not yet received, you and your doctor or other prescriber will need to decide if you need a “fast appeal.”
• The requirements for getting a “fast appeal” are the same as those for getting a “fast coverage decision” in Section F4 on page 183.
The legal term for “fast appeal” is “expedited redetermination.” Our plan will review your appeal and give you our decision
• We take another careful look at all of the information about your coverage request. We check to see if we were following all the rules when we said No to your request. We may contact you or your doctor or other prescriber to get more information. The reviewer will be someone who did not make the original coverage decision.
Deadlines for a “fast appeal”
• If we are using the fast deadlines, we will give you our answer within 72 hours after we get your appeal, or sooner if your health requires it.
• If we do not give you an answer within 72 hours, we will send your request to Level 2 of the appeals process. At Level 2, an Independent Review Entity will review your appeal.
• If our answer is Yes to part or all of what you asked for, we must give the coverage within 72 hours after we get your appeal.
• If our answer is No to part or all of what you asked for, we will send you a letter that explains why we said No.
Deadlines for a “standard appeal”
• If we are using the standard deadlines, we must give you our answer within 7 calendar days after we get your appeal, or sooner if your health requires it, except if you are asking us to pay you back for a drug you already bought. If you are asking us to pay you back for a drug you already bought, we must give you our answer within 14 calendar days after we get your appeal. If you think your health requires it, you should ask for a “fast appeal.”
• If we do not give you a decision within 7 calendar days, or 14 calendar days if you asked us to pay you back for a drug you already bought, we will send your request to Level 2 of the appeals process. At Level 2, an Independent Review Entity will review your appeal.

 If we say No to part or all of your appeal, you can choose whether to accept this decision or make another appeal. If you decide to go on to a Level 2 Appeal, the Independent Review Entity (IRE) will review our decision.
• If you want the IRE to review your case, your appeal request must be in writing. The letter we send about our decision in the Level 1 Appeal will explain how to request the Level 2 Appeal.
• When you make an appeal to the IRE, we will send them your case file. You have the right to ask us for a copy of your case file by calling Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
The legal term for an appeal to the IRE about a Part D drug is “reconsideration.”
Deadlines for “fast appeal” at Level 2
• If your health requires it, ask the Independent Review Entity (IRE) for a “fast appeal.”
• If the IRE agrees to give you a “fast appeal,” it must give you an answer to your Level 2
Appeal within 72 hours after getting your appeal request.
• If the IRE says Yes to part or all of what you asked for, we must authorize or give you the drug coverage within 24 hours after we get the decision.
Deadlines for “standard appeal” at Level 2
• If you have a standard appeal at Level 2, the Independent Review Entity (IRE) must give you an answer to your Level 2 Appeal within 7 calendar days after it gets your appeal, or 14 calendar days if you asked us to pay you back for a drug you already bought.
• If the IRE says Yes to part or all of what you asked for, we must authorize or give you the drug coverage within 72 hours after we get the decision.
• If the IRE approves a request to pay you back for a drug you already bought, we will send payment to you within 30 calendar days after we get the decision.
What if the Independent Review Entity says No to your Level 2 Appeal?
No means the Independent Review Entity (IRE) agrees with our decision not to approve your
request. This is called “upholding the decision.” It is also called “turning down your appeal.”
If you want to go to Level 3 of the appeals process, the drugs you are requesting must meet a minimum dollar value. If the dollar value is less than the minimum, you cannot appeal any further. If the dollar value is high enough, you can ask for a Level 3 appeal. The letter you get from the IRE will tell you the dollar value needed to continue with the appeal process.

G.Asking us to cover a longer hospital stay
When you are admitted to a hospital, you have the right to get all hospital services that we cover that are necessary to diagnose and treat your illness or injury.
During your covered hospital stay, your doctor and the hospital staff will work with you to prepare for the day when you leave the hospital. They will also help arrange for any care you may need after you leave.
• The day you leave the hospital is called your “discharge date.”
• Your doctor or the hospital staff will tell you what your discharge date is.
If you think you are being asked to leave the hospital too soon, you can ask for a longer hospital
stay. This section tells you how to ask.
G1. Learning about your Medicare rights
Within two days after you are admitted to the hospital, a caseworker or nurse will give you a notice called “An Important Message from Medicare about Your Rights.” If you do not get this notice, ask any hospital employee for it. If you need help, please call Member Services at the number at the bottom of this page. You can also call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048. These calls are free.
Read this notice carefully and ask questions if you don’t understand. The “Important Message” tells you about your rights as a hospital patient, including your rights to:
• Get Medicare-covered services during and after your hospital stay. You have the right to know what these services are, who will pay for them, and where you can get them.
• Be a part of any decisions about the length of your hospital stay.
• Know where to report any concerns you have about the quality of your hospital care.
• Appeal if you think you are being discharged from the hospital too soon.
You should sign the Medicare notice to show that you got it and understand your rights. Signing the notice does not mean you agree to the discharge date that may have been told to you by your doctor or hospital staff.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711.

Call the Quality Improvement Organization before you leave the hospital and no later than your planned discharge date. “An Important Message from Medicare about Your Rights” contains information on how to reach the Quality Improvement Organization.
• If you call before you leave, you are allowed to stay in the hospital after your planned discharge date without paying for it while you wait to get the decision on your appeal from the Quality Improvement Organization.
• If you do not call to appeal, and you decide to stay in the hospital after your planned discharge date, you may have to pay all of the costs for hospital care you get after your planned discharge date.
• If you miss the deadline for contacting the Quality Improvement Organization about your appeal, you can make your appeal directly to our plan instead. For details, see Section G4 on page 194.

What is a Quality Improvement Organization (QIO)?
It is a group of doctors and other health care professionals who are paid by the federal government. These experts are not part of our plan. They are paid by Medicare to check on and help improve the quality of care for people with Medicare.
Ask for a “fast review”
You must ask the Quality Improvement Organization for a “fast review” of your discharge. Asking for a “fast review” means you are asking the organization to use the fast deadlines for an appeal instead of using the standard deadlines.
The legal term for “fast review” is “immediate review.” What happens during the fast review?
• The reviewers at the Quality Improvement Organization will ask you or your representative why you think coverage should continue after the planned discharge date. You don’t have to prepare anything in writing, but you may do so if you wish.
• The reviewers will look at your medical record, talk with your doctor, and review all of the information related to your hospital stay.
• By noon of the day after the reviewers tell us about your appeal, you will get a letter that gives your planned discharge date. The letter explains the reasons why your doctor, the hospital, and we think it is right for you to be discharged on that date.
     The legal term for this written explanation is called the “Detailed Notice of Discharge.” You can get a sample by calling Member Services at the number listed at the bottom of this page. You can also call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
What if the answer is Yes?
• If the Quality Improvement Organization says Yes to your appeal, we must keep covering
your hospital services for as long as they are medically necessary.
What if the answer is No?
• If the Quality Improvement Organization says No to your appeal, they are saying that your planned discharge date is medically appropriate. If this happens, our coverage for your inpatient hospital services will end at noon on the day after the Quality Improvement Organization gives you its answer.
• If the Quality Improvement Organization says No and you decide to stay in the hospital, then you may have to pay for your continued stay at the hospital. The cost of the hospital care that you may have to pay begins at noon on the day after the Quality Improvement Organization gives you its answer.
• If the Quality Improvement Organization turns down your appeal and you stay in the hospital after your planned discharge date, then you can make a Level 2 Appeal.
G3. Level 2 Appeal to change your hospital discharge date
If the Quality Improvement Organization has turned down your appeal and you stay in the hospital after your planned discharge date, then you can make a Level 2 Appeal. You will need to contact the Quality Improvement Organization again and ask for another review.
Ask for the Level 2 review within 60 calendar days after the day when the Quality Improvement Organization said No to your Level 1 Appeal. You can ask for this review only if you stayed in the hospital after the date that your coverage for the care ended.
In Minnesota, the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) is called Livanta. You can reach Livanta at: 1-888-524-9900 (TTY: 1-888-985-8775).
• Reviewers at the Quality Improvement Organization will take another careful look at all of the information related to your appeal.
• Within 14 calendar days of receipt of your request for a second review, the Quality Improvement Organization reviewers will make a decision.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
What happens if the answer is Yes?
• We must pay you or the provider for our share of the costs of hospital care you got since noon on the day after the date of your first appeal decision. We must continue providing coverage for your inpatient hospital care for as long as it is medically necessary.
• You must continue to pay your share of the costs, and coverage limitations may apply.
What happens if the answer is No?
It means the Quality Improvement Organization agrees with the Level 1 decision and will not change it. The letter you get will tell you what you can do if you wish to continue with the appeal process.
If the Quality Improvement Organization turns down your Level 2 Appeal, you may have to pay the full cost for your stay after your planned discharge date.
G4. What happens if you miss an appeal deadline
If you miss appeal deadlines, there is another way to make Level 1 and Level 2 Appeals, called Alternate Appeals. But the first two levels of appeal are different.
Level 1 Alternate Appeal to change your hospital discharge date
If you miss the deadline for contacting the Quality Improvement Organization (which is within 60 days or no later than your planned discharge date, whichever comes first), you can make an appeal to us, asking for a “fast review.” A fast review is an appeal that uses the fast deadlines instead of the standard deadlines.
• During this review, we take a look at all of the information about your hospital stay. We check to see if the decision about when you should leave the hospital was fair and followed all the rules.
• We will use the fast deadlines rather than the standard deadlines for giving you the answer to this review. This means we will give you our decision within 72 hours after you ask for a “fast review.”
• If we say Yes to your fast review, it means we agree that you still need to be in the hospital after the discharge date. We will keep covering hospital services for as long as it is medically necessary.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711.

• If we say No to your fast review, we are saying that your planned discharge date was medically appropriate. Our coverage for your inpatient hospital services ends on the day we said coverage would end.
o If you stayed in the hospital after your planned discharge date, then you may have to pay the full cost of hospital care you got after the planned discharge date.
• To make sure we were following all the rules when we said No to your fast appeal, we will send your appeal to the “Independent Review Entity.” When we do this, it means that your case is automatically going to Level 2 of the appeals process.
The legal term for “fast review” or “fast appeal” is “expedited appeal.” Level 2 Alternate Appeal to change your hospital discharge date
We will send the information for your Level 2 Appeal to the Independent Review Entity (IRE) within 24 hours of when we give you our Level 1 decision. If you think we are not meeting this deadline or other deadlines, you can make a complaint. Section J on page 203 tells how to make a complaint.
During the Level 2 Appeal, the IRE reviews the decision we made when we said No to your “fast review.” This organization decides whether the decision we made should be changed.
• The IRE does a “fast review” of your appeal. The reviewers usually give you an answer within 72 hours.
• The IRE is an independent organization that is hired by Medicare. This organization is not connected with our plan, and it is not a government agency.
• Reviewers at the IRE will take a careful look at all of the information related to your appeal of your hospital discharge.
• If the IRE says Yes to your appeal, then we must pay you or the provider for our share of the costs of hospital care you got since the date of your planned discharge. We must also continue our coverage of your hospital services for as long as it is medically necessary.

H. What to do if you think your home health care, skilled nursing care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services are ending too soon
This section is about the following types of care only:
• Home health care services.
• Skilled nursing care in a skilled nursing facility.
• Rehabilitation care you are getting as an outpatient at a Medicare-approved Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF). Usually, this means you are getting treatment for an illness or accident, or you are recovering from a major operation.
o With any of these three types of care, you have the right to keep getting covered services for as long as the doctor says you need it.
o When we decide to stop covering any of these, we must tell you before your services end. When your coverage for that care ends, we will stop paying for your care.
If you think we are ending the coverage of your care too soon, you can appeal our decision. This section tells you how to ask for an appeal.
H1. We will tell you in advance when your coverage will be ending
• You will get a notice at least two days before we stop paying for your care. This is called the “Notice of Medicare Non-Coverage.”
• The written notice tells you the date when we will stop covering your care.
• The written notice also tells you how to appeal this decision.
You or your representative should sign the written notice to show that you got it. Signing it does not
mean you agree with the plan that it is time to stop getting the care.
When your coverage ends, we will stop paying our share of the cost for your care.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
What happens if the reviewers say Yes?
• If the reviewers say Yes to your appeal, then we must keep providing your covered services
for as long as they are medically necessary.
What happens if the reviewers say No?
• If the reviewers say No to your appeal, then your coverage will end on the date we told you.
We will stop paying for the care.
• If you decide to keep getting the home health care, skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services after the date your coverage ends, then you will have to pay the full cost of this care yourself.
H3. Level 2 Appeal to continue your care
If the Quality Improvement Organization said No to the appeal and you choose to continue getting
care after your coverage for the care has ended, you can make a Level 2 Appeal.
  At a glance: How to make a Level 2 Appeal to require that the plan cover your care for longer
Call the Quality Improvement Organization for your state at 1-888-524-9900 (TTY: 1-888-985-8775) and ask for another review.
Call before you leave the agency or facility that is providing your care and before your planned discharge date.
 During the Level 2 Appeal, the Quality Improvement Organization will take another look at the decision they made at Level 1. If they say they agree with the Level 1 decision, you may have to pay the full cost for your home health care, skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services after the date when we said your coverage would end.
In Minnesota, the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) is called Livanta. You can reach Livanta at: 1-888-524-9900 (TTY: 1-888-985-8775). Ask for the Level 2 review within 60 calendar days after the day when the Quality Improvement Organization said No to your Level 1 Appeal. You can ask for this review only if you continued getting care after the date that your coverage for the care ended.
• Reviewers at the Quality Improvement Organization will take another careful look at all of the information related to your appeal.
• The Quality Improvement Organization will make its decision within 14 calendar days of receipt of your appeal request.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.
 EOC-200.16-MSHO 199

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
What happens if the review organization says Yes?
• We must pay you or the provider for the costs of care you got since the date when we said your coverage would end. We must continue providing coverage for the care for as long as it is medically necessary.
What happens if the review organization says No?
• It means they agree with the decision they made on the Level 1 Appeal and will not change it.
• The letter you get will tell you what to do if you wish to continue with the review process. It will give you the details about how to go on to the next level of appeal, which is handled by a judge.
H4. What happens if you miss the deadline for making your Level 1 Appeal
If you miss appeal deadlines, there is another way to make Level 1 and Level 2 Appeals, called Alternate Appeals. But the first two levels of appeal are different.
Level 1 Alternate Appeal to continue your care for longer
If you miss the deadline for contacting the Quality Improvement Organization, you can make an appeal to us, asking for a “fast review.” A fast review is an appeal that uses the fast deadlines instead of the standard deadlines.
• During this review, we take a look at all of the information about your home health care, skilled nursing facility care, or care you are getting at a Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF). We check to see if the decision about when your services should end was fair and followed all the rules.
• We will use the fast deadlines rather than the standard deadlines for giving you the answer to this review. We will give you our decision within 72 hours after you ask for a “fast review.”
• If we say Yes to your fast review, it means we agree that we will keep covering your services for as long as it is medically necessary.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
• It also means that we agree to pay you or the provider for the care you got since the date when we said your coverage would end.
• If we say No to your fast review, we are saying that stopping your services was medically appropriate. Our coverage ends as of the day we said coverage would end.
If you continue getting services after the day we said they would stop, you may have to pay the full cost of the services.
To make sure we were following all the rules when we said No to your fast appeal, we will send your appeal to the “Independent Review Entity.” When we do this, it means that your case is automatically going to Level 2 of the appeals process.
The legal term for “fast review” or “fast appeal” is “expedited appeal.”
Level 2 Alternate Appeal to continue your care for longer
We will send the information for your Level 2 Appeal to the Independent Review Entity (IRE) within 24 hours of when we give you our Level 1 decision. If you think we are not meeting this deadline or other deadlines, you can make a complaint. Section J on page 203 tells how to make a complaint.
During the Level 2 Appeal, the IRE reviews the decision we made when we said No to your “fast review.” This organization decides whether the decision we made should be changed.
• The IRE does a “fast review” of your appeal. The reviewers usually give you an answer within 72 hours.
• The IRE is an independent organization that is hired by Medicare. This organization is not connected with our plan, and it is not a government agency.
• Reviewers at the IRE will take a careful look at all of the information related to your appeal.
If you have questions, please call HealthPartners MSHO Member Services at 952-967-7029 or 888-820-4285. TTY users should call 711. Hours are: Oct.1 through March 31, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, April 1 to Sept. 30, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday – Friday. The call is free. For more information, visit healthpartners.com/msho.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)
• If the IRE says Yes to your appeal, then we must pay you or the provider for the cost of care. We must also continue our coverage of your services for as long as it is medically necessary.
• If the IRE says No to your appeal, it means they agree with us that stopping coverage of services was medically appropriate.
The letter you get from the IRE will tell you what you can do if you wish to continue with the review process. It will give you details about how to go on to a Level 3 Appeal, which is handled by a judge.
I. Taking your appeal beyond Level 2
I1. Next steps for Medicare services and items
If you made a Level 1 Appeal and a Level 2 Appeal for Medicare services or items, and both your appeals have been turned down, you may have the right to additional levels of appeal. The letter you get from the Independent Review Entity will tell you what to do if you wish to continue the appeals process.
Level 3 of the appeals process is an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing. The person who makes the decision in a Level 3 appeal is an ALJ or an attorney adjudicator. If you want an ALJ or attorney adjudicator to review your case, the item or medical service you are requesting must meet a minimum dollar amount. If the dollar value is less than the minimum level, you cannot appeal any further. If the dollar value is high enough, you can ask an ALJ or attorney adjudicator to hear your appeal.
If you do not agree with the ALJ or attorney adjudicator’s decision, you can go to the Medicare Appeals Council. After that, you may have the right to ask a federal court to look at your appeal.
If you need assistance at any stage of the appeals process, you can call the Ombudsman for Public Managed Health Care Programs. The phone number is 651-431-2660 or 1-800-657-3729 or TTY MN Relay 711.
I2. Next steps for Medical Assistance (Medicaid) services and items
You also have more appeal rights if your appeal is about services or items that might be covered by Medical Assistance (Medicaid). If you disagree with the ruling from the State Appeal (Medicaid Fair Hearing with the state) process, you may appeal to the District Court in your county by calling the county clerk. You have 30 days to file an appeal with District Court.
If you need help at any stage of the process, you can call the Ombudsman for Public Managed Health Care Programs at 651-431-2660 or 1-800-657-3729 or TTY MN Relay 711.

HealthPartners MSHO MEMBER HANDBOOK Chapter 10: Ending your membership in our Plan
 A. When you can end your membership in our plan
Most people with Medicare can end their membership during certain times of the year. Because you have Medicaid, you may be able to end your membership in our plan or switch to a different plan one time during each of the following Special Enrollment Periods:
• January to March
• April to June
• July to September
In addition to these three Special Enrollment periods, you may end your membership in our plan during the following periods:
• The Annual Enrollment Period, which lasts from October 15 to December 7. If you choose a new plan during this period, your membership in HealthPartners MSHO will end on December 31 and your membership in the new plan will start on January 1.
• The Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period, which lasts from January 1 to March 31. If you choose a new plan during this period, your membership in the new plan will start the first day of the next month.
There may be other situations when you are eligible to make a change to your enrollment. For example, such as when:
• You have moved out of our service area,
• Your eligibility for Medicaid or Extra Help has changed, or
• You are getting care in a nursing home or a long-term care hospital.
Your membership will end on the last day of the month that we get your request to change your plan. For example, if we get your request on January 18, your coverage with our plan will end on January 31. Your new coverage will begin the first day of the next month (February 1, in this example).

• Medicare options in the table in Section C1 of this chapter.

Daily cost-sharing rate: A rate that may apply when your doctor prescribes less than a full month’s supply of certain drugs for you and you are required to pay a copay. A daily cost- sharing rate is the copay divided by the number of days in a month’s supply.
Here is an example: Let’s say the copay for your drug for a full month’s supply (a 30-day supply) is $1.30. This means that the amount you pay for your drug is a little more than $0.04 per day. If you get a 7 days’ supply of the drug, your payment will be a little more than $0.04 per day multiplied by 7 days, for a total payment of about $0.30.

While you are a member of our plan, you must use network providers to get covered services. Network providers are also called plan providers or participating providers.

Original Medicare (traditional Medicare or fee-for-service Medicare): Original Medicare is offered by the government. Under Original Medicare, Medicare services are covered by paying doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers amounts that are set by Congress.
• You can see any doctor, hospital, or other health care provider that accepts Medicare. Original Medicare has two parts: Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance).
• Original Medicare is available everywhere in the United States.
• If you do not want to be in our plan, you can choose Original Medicare.

Palliative care can be given at the same time as treatments meant to cure or treat the disease. Palliative care may be given when the illness is diagnosed, throughout treatment, during follow-up, and at the end of life.
